      "**Nose:** You often hear of whisky from “time gone by” and this is certainly one of those. There’s something very distinctive and unrefined, in the best of ways, about whisky that was bottled some decades ago. Coal gas, tar and soot give this more of a gassy odour, than an aroma...certainly unique. Behind the gas cloud we find herbal sage, wet sand, artichoke flower, kiwi, lime and freshly mowed lawns. Some floral rosewater really adds some needed sweetness. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Palate:** Stove gas, lawn, dried flowers. Given a few seconds more and it becomes bafflingly fizzy alongside rich butter on crumpets, olive oil, concentrated dandelion and burdock mixed into sour Belgian gueuze. There’s certainly a meatiness here too, like chewing on some thick beef stew that’s been sat all day on the stove with a little rosemary and thyme.\n",

Two things of note here; one: Dufftown is a seriously fabulous distillery and it pains be to see it crippled at the hands of Diageo. It’s rich, meaty profile is worthy of such high praise, yet it’s very rarely allowed to shine other than through a few sparse, independent bottlings. B: This is notably a very old school character; it’s unrefined, a little sour, gassy and fizzy, none of which you would ever find in modern refined distillate. Perhaps it’s rose-tinted glasses, but I really miss this style of whisky. There’s just so much more diversity and character from the whisky of this era. It pains me to say that this is some of the best whisky I’ve had from SMWS of late and I’d put that down almost in its entirety to being distilled in the 70s. Rose-tinted glasses indeed, but I can’t help but wish I’d had more chance to try the abundance of wackiness from times gone by. \n",

I couldn’t help but think of the flavors and thoughts associated with them as ER10 being Fall, with it’s brown sugar and baking spices, while ETL was more of a Spring feel with fresh flowers and fruit. Another interesting observation was ER10 had more of a sugar taste, while ETL had more honey.\n",

      "**Overall:** This is definitely a good pour, especially given it’s price point. It’s a shame that it’s so difficult to find though. Compared directly to ER10, I’d pick the latter, but that’s just my personal opinion. I couldn’t help but think of the flavors and thoughts associated with them as ER10 being Fall, with it’s brown sugar and baking spices, while ETL was more of a Spring feel with fresh flowers and fruit. Another interesting observation was ER10 had more of a sugar taste, while ETL had more honey.\n",

      "- Color: Very light, almost white wine like, the lightest whisky i've seen to date\n",
      "- Nose: Lots of peat, and perhaps a slight hint of sea-air\n",
      "- Palate: Again, lots of peat, with a hint of salt/pepper, although nowhere near the levels found in Laphroaig 10, followed by a strong warming sensation, probably because it is 46% ABV, versus 40% for most of my drinks.\n",
      "- Finish: A strong warm sensation sliding down the back of your throat, lingering in your belly for a minute, while leaving a hint of peat, and the faintest taste of fruity hard candy in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: 82, an interesting scotch, but it comes across as a little one-dimensional to me compared to the other big islay, the laphroaig 10. The burn/heat from the alcohol is stronger, and the peat leaves little place for anything else.\n",

      "Ardbeg 10 yr. Enjoyed in a odorless bar in Southern California, with some XM radio tunes going in the background\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance: Light Champagne color. When I first saw it poured I thought it looked like white whiskey. On closer examine, it had a tiny bit of color\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose: Smoke, Brine, sea salt, faint rubbing alcohol in the background. Very simple nose but it sure drew me in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palate: Campfire upfront. I didn't ever expect to experience drinking a campfire. The salt and the brine flavors follow in the palate. Low viscosity but it matches the flavors in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish: I'm an aging/failing dragon, breathing smoke. It's a peculiar finish for me. For a split second, it seems like the smoke finish is going to dry me out, but then I find that I'm salivating for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: I typically like something a little thicker/sherried/fruity but this was one intensely good dram. After drinking it, I came home and craved a cigar. I haven't smoke a cigar in 8 years. Look forward to sampling the other offerings and adding a bottle or two of Ardberg to my collection.\n",

      "*Taste:  Once again spicy.  The regular balvenie taste you get in expressions such as the double wood or the single barrel is there it has just been drowned out by the spice.  The spice is sort of a dry pepery taste.  I would almost equate the flavor to a calmer bourbon that does not kick you in the teeth.  I also get a slight rum flavor which I am not that big of a fan of but then again what do you expect.  \n",

      "First - an explanation about why I would even consider trying this bourbon.  I'm a long-time lurker on here, and I started drinking bourbon seven or eight years ago.  However, I am frugal by nature (and necessity), and drink relatively little.  When I started, I had a job that permitted some luxuries in the \"drink\" department.  However, three years ago I left my career to work for a non-profit that I loved.  It was a good move, but there were two major sacrifices - the first was financial (50% paycut), the second was that the job required me to move with my family and live on site, and alcohol was not permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "About six months ago, our board revised the alcohol policy, so I'm starting to make up for missed time.  But, given the financial sacrifice we made, I'm committed to spending as little as possible on this luxury.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I decided to start reviewing bourbons, starting with the absolute cheapest I could find in our state store (I live in PA), and I'll work up the shelves until I find something I both enjoy and can spend money on.\n",
      "\n",
      "*So - with no further ado, here is my first review:*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bourbon Name**: Banker’s Club\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottled in NY by Regent Distillers, but the brand is owned by Lairds (think AppleJack Brandy).   The quality of their web presence matches the quality of the product (more on that later). \n",
      "\n",
      "**ABV**: 40% (80 Proof)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cost:** 8.99 / Liter (seriously)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Age:** 3 years\n",
      "\n",
      "**Color:** Light amber.  Looks young.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** (Remember to sniff your elbow first) sweet, rotten fruit, some chemicals…not harsh at all.  No oak, no distinct spice. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:** I’ll be honest – I was expecting the worst.  I figured it would be harsh and chemically.  But, thanks to its low ABV, it didn’t burn at all.  It was a little viscous, but really not very flavorful.  There was some unexpected sweetness up front, kind of yeasty even.  It really just didn’t have much to stand out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish:** Sweet and cherries.  But not good or delicious cherry, or even cherry flavored candy…this was more the cherry flavor of cheap cherry flavored chapstick.  Only on the aftertaste in the very back of the throat was there even any indication of oak – but not a pleasant indication.  It does stick with you for a little while. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall impression:** Look – it wasn’t good. But it wasn’t nearly as terrible as its bottom-shelf and rock bottom price and zero-info website would make me expect.  Which is weird.  I was kind of hoping for something absolutely terrible that I could blast apart on here, but I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn’t awful.  It just wasn’t good or distinctive.  It didn’t really taste like what I expected from a bourbon at all – it simply didn’t have much flavor.  As a result, if you’re looking for something solely to mix for your friends that aren’t interested in quality, this is your ticket, because the taste isn’t spit-take-bad.  It just isn’t good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the real downside of this experiment, and this bottle in particular, is that I don’t just have 750 ml to get through, it is a full liter.  And since it isn’t bad enough to pour down the drain, but it isn’t good enough to merit regular drinking, it might be a while until I can justify my next purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Score:** 50 / 100 – Not recommended, but I’ve had worse that I’ve spent more on.  I’m not angry that I bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Score Justification:** 80 would be where I would put my preferred daily drinker (Buffalo Trace), and 25 would be where I would put on that is bad enough that I would never consider drinking it again (but still too frugal to pour out).  Under 25 would go down the drain (haven’t had anything that bad…yet!).  I would rate probably everything I’ve had except for the Jim Beam White Label above this.     \n",

      "I took a gamble bought a bottle of this stuff without having tried it before. I was in the mood for something new, and the packaging of this one caught my eye. Packaging is not something I feel normally warrants any attention when reviewing, but I must say it's quite nice in this case -- minimal and striking.  I bought the short-'n'-stout 750ml bottle for just shy of 70 USD. It's 46% alc./vol. The sleeve says it's \"Edition 2.10,\" whatever the fuck that means.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm actually going to write this review as I try it for the first time. Bad form, maybe, but I'll add amendments later as necessary. I'll be trying a dram neat and then another with a couple drops of water. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Visual Appearance**: One of the very few scotches I've had to which the word \"amber\" does not readily apply. It's a lovely pale gold color. A swirl around the glass leaves long-lasting legs, hinting at some rich oiliness. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose**: \"Warm\" is the first word to come to mind. Warm and sweet. A lot of grain. Suggestions of honey, apple, and almost imperceptible floral notes. Brings to mind what one might smell walking past a bakery in the morning. No abrasiveness -- all invitation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste/mouthfeel**: A sip confirms the oiliness -- wonderful \"full-bodiedness.\" A subtle alcohol burn (again, think \"warm\"), but still no abrasiveness. Nutty (almond), woodsy, almost citric, sweet flavor, though the sweetness is not overpoweringly rich (still more sweet than I tend to prefer, though). Spicy/herbal -- cinnamon? Nutmeg? The apple comes through a little more here than it does in the nose. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish**: I was expecting the burn to kick in here, but there's just a brief flash of greater intensity, and then it's gone. The more grainy flavors quickly fade and the citrus/sweetness sticks around, along with the rich texture itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Rating**: Overall, I'm pleased with the gamble I took in buying this bottle. Though it's an Islay, it feels more like a good Speyside. I don't really have the palate for a lot of sweetness in scotch (or anything else), but it's pleasant here. There's a fair amount of complexity and character, without so much challenge as to be off-putting to an undeveloped palate such as mine. It's certainly a good introduction to the Bruichladdich line.\n",

      "This is a simple bourbon. The nose, taste, and finish are all gentle and appeal to me. I'd consider this a very nice \"summer\" or \"dessert\" bourbon. The flavor profile is not complex, but that's not a knock on this bourbon in the slightest. It's very smooth and I can hold it in my mouth indefinitely with no desire to cool it down. Additionally, I have no desire to add water, ice, or use it in a cocktail - neat is all I need. I often find myself drinking large gulps and before I know it, I'm pouring a second \\[heavy\\] glass. This is the first bottle of Eagle Rare that I've owned and halfway through the 1.75L I've learned a very valuable lesson in bourbon tasting: **Simple Does NOT Equal Low Quality**. Moving forward I plan to keep Eagle Rare stocked on my shelf at all times and will seek to find more 1.75L bottles. Although this bottle does not state \"single barrel\" on the label, many individuals claim that taste differs across bottles. I am curious to test this theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, I would consider this an good bourbon and I like Eagle Rare more than Buffalo Trace (my baseline bourbon). \"Simple\" bourbons don't typically appeal to me in the same way that this bottle does. There is not a lot of \"intrigue\", just smooth vanilla bliss. With that said, I've enjoyed drinking this bottle very much I will assign this bottle an elevated score of **90/100**. Please note that as I perform more reviews, my scores may be adjusted.\n",

      "The BT mashbill #2 has a special place in my heart. Have loved the regular ETL for a while, both regular release and store select barrels. Blanton's is nice, albeit a bit too polished, or even 'stripped' for me. Rock Hill Farms is a special one, has a lot of character all its own and I could pick it out blind anytime. The Blanton's Straight From The Barrel just floors me, and I hope to get some Blanton's Gold sometime soon. AAA 10 Star is a recent try, and has far more to it than I had expected- now a regular pour. \n",

      "**Background**  After touring the Four Roses distillery in December I gave this bottle a new home.  They had several different kinds of cask strength single barrel \"private selections\" (selected by Rutledge himself) that are only available at their gift shop.  I asked the tour guide for his opinion of which option *he* liked most and he handed me the OESF without hesitation.  He said it was a unique recipe with some very distinguishable characteristics.  He said some people love it and a lot of people hate it.  After deciding he was a knowledgeable resource, I reluctantly forked over $60 figuring it was worth the gamble.  Here it goes...\n",

These are the only two bourbons I've had with this much cherry character, so I believe it is still a worthy comparison.  Good stuff.  I can't promise you that all OESF bottles will be to your liking, but Jim Rutledge certainly picked out a great one to go into my bottle.  Put me in the \"love\" camp on this one.\n",

At first, tart cherry and sherry dominated the nose until further into the bottle when vanilla began to dominate accompanied by smashed raisins. I never picked up chocolate or spice notes as other reviewers have noted.   \n",
      "Palate: I was shocked by the “in your face” wet ash flavor in the first few drams but, fortunately, it disappeared as I moved deeper into the bottle where tart cherry became the dominate note. It was a bit oily on the palate but not as thick as I was expecting. Unfortunately, tart cherry continued to dominate dragging along a little sherry, dark espresso and a slight alcohol burn. I searched for other flavor notes to no avail.   \n",
      "Finish: The finish is incredibly long with the tart cherry remaining an my palate for almost an hour. The finish was reminiscent of  the Macallan Edition 6 in that its finish lasted an incredibly long time as well. It’s a finish the one keeps thinking about for hours, or even days.  \n",
      "Summary: The Allardice is not very complex and a little rough around the edges. I realize the neck pour can be harsh; however, I wasn’t expecting wet ash. I compared the GD18 Allardice to the Macallan 18 Sherry Cask and found the Mac18 to be smoother and more elegant without the rough edges. That said, as I moved further into the bottle, the Allardice became quite enjoyable. It’s rustic in a good way. I decided to buy 2 more bottles to keep in stock  \n",

      "\n",
      "Palate: Well, it's very smooth! Some spice to it, mostly on the back of my tongue. It's sweet, but not like too-much-sugar sweet, more like agave nectar sweet. I taste the wine toward the end of the sip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish: All of my enjoyment is in the finish. First, it tastes like I just chewed and swallowed a bite of dark chocolate. Sort of bitter, but still sweet. No immediate bite, but after 2 seconds, there's a fiery whip in my throat. But I like that in a drink. More spice at the end. Finally, the taste lingers for a good 15-20 seconds, even on smaller sips. \n",

      "**Finish:** As the fresher notes fade, the stronger wood flavors come in. Get a bit of oak before it bursts out with this smokiness. The smokey aftertaste is overwhelming and lingers for a long time after. There is also some more salt that ebbs back in.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Proof:** 86 **Served:** Neat **Glass:** Glencairn **Price:** $20\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** I'm getting strong notes of vanilla and similar earthy spices like cinammon, nutmeg, etc. without being able to pick out specific ones. There is a light brown sugar element also and a hint of tobacco. I'm not getting a lot of wood notes which I'm surprised considering this is \"extra aged\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:**  This bourbon tastes very close to how it smells - vanilla and those earthy spices. It is also very light and watery and doesn't linger around very much at all once swallowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish:** The finish is light and sweet, almost a molassesy flavor, and where I first get a very slight wood note.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall:** I think this is a good entry-level bourbon for someone like me as it is not overwhelming and seems pretty straightforward (see the nose matching the taste above). I tend to prefer a slightly sweeter, fuller-mouthed bourbon to Jim Beam Black's so I don't expect this to be a bourbon on my normal rotation to drink straight. I feel like this may be best prepared with a little bit of water to allow the alcohol to cool off and bring forward that vanilla flavor I was finding. I picked this bourbon from the guide posted on this sub, but out of the \"expect sweet caramel, ripe cherries, creamy chocolate and freshly sawed oak\" I really only got the caramel and none of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Grade:** 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a bit of background since this is my first review on here, bourbon has always been my liquor of choice but I have usually drank it on the rocks, in an old fashioned, manhattan, or just added to some sweet tea or lemonade. I've never really taken it seriously but I thought it was about time I start exploring this hobby. I've dipped and chewed tobacco for the past 15 years so my reviews, as you see, have a pairing recommendation.\n",

It is a little hotter than some other BiBs that I've had recently, but not unpleasant.  I'm really impressed by the oak flavor - I haven't had that too much in most of the inexpensive bourbons I've been reviewing.  When I imagine what a bourbon is supposed to taste like, this matches up pretty well.

Because of the style, this bottle is very similar in profile to Lagavulin 16 and Ardbeg Uigeadail. If you enjoy those bottlings, I highly recommend you try this. This bottle is also $20 cheaper than both of those in my area, so there is some decent value here. Another takeaway is really how great the mouthfeel is on this, something I'd never thought I would point out in a whiskey. Its such an easy scotch to chew on, and take your time with. This might be too sweet for some, but I am not one of them.\n",

      "NOTE: I may be using the terms a bit differently than the status quo. To me, \"body\" is the liquid in the glass, \"palette\" is the liquid in the mouth, \"taste\" is the sensation which immediately follows swallowing, and \"finish\" is everything after \"taste\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**NEAT:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Color:** Really, who cares? You get a +1 if I don't think you use E150, otherwise it doesn't matter (unless matured in wine casks a la Quinta Ruban). This is rather light, and considering the high amount of cask contact it had in the quarter cask, I doubt extra coloring was utilized...so +1.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** That familiar Laphroaig nose, however SOMETHING was different (poured a dram of 10 just now). The 10 is a bit more \"raw band-aid\" with less maple syrup and floral undertones. Still, the same basic Laphroaig nose which is less smoke and more peat and iodine than say, Ardbeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Body:** Again, I don't think this matters too much unless it points to a short finish. The nose makes it quickly apparent this won't be the case though. It is viscous and oily with long legs, like all good Islays should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Palette:** This is where I started to get excited about this dram. While held in the mouth the nose and the palette are the most diametrically opposed experiences possible. Maple syrup, honey, carnations, and unlit vanilla pipe tobacco, without a hint of the band aids or smoke showing through. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:** Once swallowed, all of the sweetness and hints of floral are washed away by a rush of the aforementioned band aids and smoke. The difference between the smoke here and the smoke in the 10 year old shines through immediately. The 10 year has the smoke of a campfire on the beach the next morning after putting it out with sea water. The smoke here is fresh, like you had to put out that same campfire the night before while it is still crackling because the police showed up to interrupt your little beach party. While I still prefer the taste of Ardbeg's smoke, the dramatic shift in flavors upon swallowing and the freshness give this a definite leg up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish:** Everything comes together so beautifully it can bring a tear to your eye. The fresh, warming smoke lingers forever, but as time passes the floral notes make a slight reemergence and the vanilla pipe tobacco becomes apparent again...maybe with a little bit of pepper lingering in the background. The Laphroaig trademark band aids are still there, but instead of standing out like in the 10 year, they are mixed with a bit of metallic taste and cowering far in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say, this is an amazingly articulate, complex, beautiful malt. There is no way in hell I could recommend it to someone new, as personally I would not have appreciated it at all as little as 3 months ago...and not even enjoyed it in the least 6 months ago. If you are looking for something to expand on the basic Islay and have explored the Highlands already, this is the dram for you. I absolutely hate to give this score, because I want to leave room for something to unseat my \"current favorite\", but at this price ($45 US) and this level of complexity and absolute deliciousness:\n",

      "- Nose: Strong medicinal alcohol quickly gives way to heavy peat with accents of vanilla, caramelized apples, and just a hint of smoke.  It's strange, but I swear there might be a little cinnamon in there also. As a side note, my dog would not drink it but was very intrigued by the smell.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Finish:  This is where the QC's Islay roots shine through.  The sweetness still lingers, but is quickly overpowered as the smokiness blooms.  Not a slow smoldering smokiness, but more akin to a freshly built campfire with a slightly damp oak log recently added to a hot flame. Builds slowly, and will last quite a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an amazing whisky for the price.  The initial impression is a bit strong and medicinal, but gradually softens as it gives way to the fulller oak and smoke flavors with a plethora of subtle accents as you go.

      "**First Exposure**: Dinner at a restaurant in Buckhead Atlanta.  This place is generally really good when it comes to their pours.  I often drink Boss Hog, Macallan Rare Cask, or even Yamazaki 18.  I like that they can keep it in stock, but to their consternation, in order to get a decent sized delivery they have to keep some sub par wines in stock.  I wanted to try something different and after reading this sub and after spending a lot of time with Japanese, rye, and sherry finished single malts I tried **Oban 14 year**.  The one thing I recall the most about that night was how smooth and sweet but not cloyingly so.  Rocks glass, big cube.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tonight's Pour**:  I really like the bottle, the color, and the overall presentation and package.  Tasteful font and graphics.  The whiskey itself is a gorgeous, and probably unnatural, copper or mid gold.  Nose at the bottle and after sitting in a mug?  Slight malt, distant smoke, some citrus like lemon but more clean instead of acidic.  Very much oak forward, maybe just a few floral notes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Undiluted and rested**:  Incredibly clean, oak at the forefront, little heat, slight tobacco.  Citrus still.  Savory herbs.  \n",

      "**On Ice**:  Perfectly balanced sweet tea, tobacco, malt on the back end, pecan, oak that has been cut and sitting for some time, with the occasional sweet floral note on the finish.  Even less heat and it just goes down...\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**:  For the price I wouldn't purchase this often, but I bet I'd keep two pours left in a bottle and keep it squirreled away, knowing I would want to replenish it.  I love the deep, distant tobacco and floral notes. \n",

It isn't complex, but it is very drinkable, especially with ice or water, and I imagine it would mix great too.

      "Nose: cinnamon red hots, werther’s butterscotch, caramel covered green apples, allspice. No proof burn after resting 15 min\n",
      "\n",
      "Palate: rich vanilla and caramel quickly followed by more cinnamon red hot toward the back of the pallet. Not sickly sweet or overbearing, just perfectly tingly. Very slight ethanol. So much sweet caramel on the front of the palate dancing with cinnamon baking spice, maybe nutmeg, on the back. The fruit falls quiet behind the pleasant spice. Very viscous, oily mouthfeel leaves you completely unwanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish: more slight proof heat on the exhale. The green apple again finds its way through the ever-lingering spice. Very very mild oak, virtually no distinguishable age on this pour, not to any detriment. Cinnamon red hot now exhales as warm firebreath with an underlying candied sweetness.\n",

      "Overall: I love this pour. I hate the fanatic worship of Buffalo trace products but this shit is good. The availability in Georgia is shit and you generally have to be either very lucky or know someone. I prefer this to W12, and am hopefully soon to try full proof and see how they compare. Overall this bourbon is excellent and hits a sweet spot in proof/mouthfeel and sweet/spicy for me. At msrp I love it, but I wouldn’t pay more than that. I hope this review is helpful to people with FOMO. For reference some of my other favorite pours are RR13, BN17, EHTBP B10, JMCB, and Barrell Dovetail.\n",

I really enjoy the flavor and mouthfeel of higher proof bourbons but have challenges with the higher proofs - just messes with my gut.

      "\n",

      "So here goes:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bourbon Name:** Trader Joe's Straight Kentucky Bourbon\n",
      "Distilled by Bourbon Square Distilling in Louisville KY.  With a little research, I am convinced that this is a product actually made under Buffalo Trace/Sazerac ownership (which had me even more excited to try) in the Barton 1792 Distillery.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**ABV:** 45% (90 Proof)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cost:** 15.99 / 750ml\n",
      "\n",
      "**Age:** No age statement, so I assume at least 4 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Color:** Medium amber.  Matches the dark chestnut finish on my table.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nose:** (Remember to sniff your elbow first) Fruit and nail polish remover.  Mostly banana.  Little bit of oak.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taste:** The initial taste has a little bit of oak and some sweetish molasses flavor, but also a very astringent chemical burn and peppery spice.  The burn isn't long, but it is harsh.  This is not a smooth drink at all - I've had much higher proof that are much easier to drink.  Even letting it rest and adding some water only helped a little.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish:** The initial burn is gone quickly, but the whiskey leaves behind a syrupy reminder of itself.  It is kind of viscous.  If I reach real hard I can detect a weak vanilla flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall impression:** I had high hopes here.  Trader Joe's is known for striking it lucky with low-cost/high-quality products (even if the consistency isn't there - [read this great article about their award winning <$5 wines](http://nowiknow.com/winning-the-wine-lottery/)), but this was bad.  One of the worst I've had.  I can't even say it is a good deal for the price - there are plenty of cheaper and better mixers out there.  My only hope is that TJ is as inconsistent with their bourbon as they are with their wines, and perhaps there are some really good bottles out there, but after trying this one, I doubt I'll buy this again.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Score:** 30 / 100 – Very disappointing.  I do not recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Score Justification:** 80 would be where I would put my preferred daily drinker (Buffalo Trace), and 25 would be where I would put on that is bad enough that I would never consider drinking it again (but still too frugal to pour out). Under 25 would go down the drain (haven’t had anything that bad…yet!). I would rate probably everything I’ve had except for the Jim Beam White Label above this.\n",
