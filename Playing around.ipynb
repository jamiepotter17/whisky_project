I've seen plenty of whisky here, mostly JW, but this one stood out from the rest.  100 pipers is not something I've seen before and it seems to have quite the following here.  It is a blend at 40% alcohol by volume and 35cl was 220 baht or about $8 Canadian.  I got it more as a novelty as I suspect it is the Thai equivalent of chivas or glenfiddich 12.\\n\\nColour: caramel, I suspect it is artificially coloured.\\n\\nNose: (I had some tiger balm on my hands so this may be *way* off) alcohol, little bit of leather and some hints of sweetness.\\n\\nPalate: very bland, I taste almost nothing really, a bit of woody flavour, the promise of leather and sweetness from the nose is gone.\\n\\nFinish: short and devoid of anything but alcohol.\\n\\nThis reminds me of a JW red or the cheap rye my Dad drank when I was a kid.  I bought it primarily for the novelty so I don't think it was a waste.  it is just not something I'd seek out again.\\n\\n68/100\\n\\nPS: Yes it is a photo essay of me drinking the scotch.\",\n",

       " \"**Background:**  \\nOver the holidays I was able to find a bottle of 1792 Aged 12 Years and thought it’d be a fun idea to have a flight comparing it against the Small Batch and Full Proof. I was curious to see how the flavor profile would change with age and/or proof while also looking for possible commonalities between the three.   \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Small Batch**  \\n**Retail:** $29.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Honey  \\n**Proof and Age:** 93.7 proof with NAS (Rumored to be aged with barrels 6-9 years old)  \\n**Nose:** Ethanol is strong on the nose. Rye spice, vanilla, and creamier caramel notes appear after letting the bourbon breath.   \\n**Palate:** Rye spices make for a sharp palate upfront. Notes of caramel do break through mid-palate once the heat subsides, with hints of vanilla.   \\n**Finish:** Baking spices and alcohol result in a long finish that burns slightly. A stronger oak presence rounds out a drier finish.  \\n**Score:** 6.4/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Full Proof**  \\n**Retail:** $59.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Light Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 125 proof with NAS (Press release states an age around 8.5 years)  \\n**Nose**: Ethanol overwhelms the nose. However, strong caramel and banana notes do appear after a few minutes. When taking my first sip I detected a sweeter vanilla scent.   \\n**Palate:** An oily heat bombards upfront on the palate. However, it is not abrasive and the palate quickly evolved into a sweeter combination of vanilla and maple syrup. Strong notes of cinnamon were also present with a fruiter note towards the back of the palate that I’d describe as raisins. Brown sugar appears mid-palate after adding a few drops of water.   \\n**Finish:** Like the Small Batch, baking spices, white pepper, and alcohol create a lingering Kentucky Hug that burns and overpowers. Once the heat subsides dry charred oak notes take over, reminding me of times campfire smoke blows in my face.   \\n**Score:** 7.1/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Aged 12 Years**  \\n**Retail:** $69.99 in Wisconsin  \\n**Color:** Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 96.6 proof aged for 12 years  \\n**Nose:** The nose is not a punch like the Small Batch and Full Proof. Heavy brown sugar and caramel notes, along with vanilla and toffee, make this nose a sweet bomb. Hints of oak poke through, but are quickly covered up.   \\n**Palate:** Unlike the nose, the palate is relatively dry. Toasted oak is the main protagonist and decent legs allow it to encompass the palate. Towards the rear of the palate spicier cinnamon notes contrast with sweeter caramel to add some complexity to an otherwise one-dimensional palate.   \\n**Finish:** Similar to the palate, the finish is oak-forward and leaves a nice and mild Kentucky Hug. Baking spices and hints of cinnamon add to what is a very dry finish. However, unlike the Full Proof the oak has a bitter tannin taste.   \\n**Score:** 7.6/10  \\n🥃  \\n**Overall:**   \\nWhile these are three decent bourbons, each has a flaw that holds it back from being a great bourbon in my mind. While a solid bottom shelf bourbon, youthful nature of the Small Batch inhibits it from being anything other than a mixer in my eyes. The Full Proof had the most dimension on the palate and was quite enjoyable once the heat dissipated. However compared to other high-proof bourbons, the heat antagonized more subtle flavors, inhibiting it from being in the same category as an ECBP. My favorite of the three, the 12 year 1792 was smooth and lacked any heat, helping elevate it above the others. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional oak palate and finish lacked the complexity I was hoping for with an older bourbon. I feel sweeter marshmallow or vanilla notes would elevate this otherwise bland profile into a truly great bourbon. Overall, the biggest surprise was the prevalence of a drier oak finish for each bourbon. I’d like to hear what you all think of these bourbons and what you believe is the optimal proof or age for a 1792 bourbon.   \\n🥃 [PREVIOUS REVIEWS](https://www.facebook.com/oaknchar/) 🥃  \\n**Scoring:**   \\n1 - Better used as a fire starter or drain cleaner  \\n2 - Undrinkable, last resort where one sip is enough  \\n3 - Vulgar, painful to finish a pour and the bottle will probably gather dust  \\n4 - Indecent, would be average but something doesn't sit right   \\n5 - Average, run of the mill that goes well with a chaser  \\n6 - Decent, usually added into cocktails or on ice  \\n7 - Good, can drink straight without complaining   \\n8 - Great, something reserved for close family or friends  \\n9 - Excellent, something reserved for those special moments in life  \\n10 - Perfection, the precious to my Gollum\",\n",
       " 'The 1792 series continues and this time we are getting into some of the rare stocks with the 225th Anniversary. This one took a bit of work to track down as it was a one time commemorative release to celebrate the 225th anniversary of Kentucky joining the union, mostly for good. Otherwise this is a small batch, extra aged release in the same odd bottle shape that confounds my whiskey organization attempts.\\n\\n## Review\\n**Age**: NAS but the bottle says \"nearly a decade\"\\n\\n**Abv**: 92.15 proof (46.075% ABV)\\n\\n**Color**: A deep amber with hints of red\\n\\n### Neat\\n**Nose**: Starts with a sweet brown sugar note complimented by dark cherries and a bit of balancing  baking spice\\n\\n**Taste**: Very similar to the nose though the spice is a bit more muted. This could easily fill in for a cherry pie as a dessert. Excellent mouthfeel especially given the middling proof\\n\\n**Finish**: A little shorter and hotter than I would have liked. The baking spice mingles with the brown sugar in this medium length, medium heat finish.\\n\\n### On a rock\\n**Nose**: The spice is gone leaving the intoxicating brown sugar and cherry combination\\n\\n**Taste**: The baking spice and cherries comes to the forefront with the brown sugar note taking a back seat. Even better than it was neat. Oddly the ice actually made this feel a bit thinner in the mouthfeel for me.\\n\\n**Finish**: The heat from the neat finish is gone and the spice and brown sugar notes remain for a medium duration.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nFirst off this whiskey was excellent as I\\'ve come to expect from the higher end 1792 expressions (I\\'ll have to do the small batch at some point haha). I really enjoyed the fruity notes in this one and wasn\\'t expecting them. Surprisingly the neat finish was a bit hotter than the [1792 Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/) despite coming in over 32 proof points lower. The hot but sort of short finish kept it out of the 9 territory but just barely!

       " 'Bourbon Review #48 1792 225th Anniversary \\n\\nSample obtained from Scotchswap via the always marvelous /u/Pork_Bastard.  1792 is a Sazerac company brand distilled by Barton. This was a special edition bottle released only in Kentucky to commemorate its 225th year as a state. Why 225?  No idea aside from a desire to sell bourbon. These barrels were \"hand selected\" to go into this small batch.  I presume as opposed to the usual process of employing an android or other non human means. As far as I know they made no claims to aging this in a watercraft of any kind.  So there\\'s that. This bourbon is 10 years old according to the interwebs. \\n\\nImage is not mine. \\n\\nConsumed neat in a Glencairn. \\n\\n**Color**:  A rather light golden amber\\n\\n**abv**: 46.075%, 92.15 Proof. What is this, Scotch?\\n\\n**Nose:** A fair bit of acetone to go with a solid oaky wood profile. Some dried herbs and cigar leaf wrapper come through. Later some vanilla arrives to the party. \\n\\n**Taste:**  Gentle, with lots of wood and herbal flavors, following the nose. There\\'s a bit of spice here, baking spices blending with some oaky vanilla. Body is thin.  \\n\\n**Finish:**  Surprisingly warming, but rather short. It\\'s a nice blend of wood, vanilla and dried herbs or tobacco, but doesn\\'t last. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Saw some reviews getting caramel and butterscotch, I\\'m not getting that.  In fact this is really quite dry, with predominantly a wood/herbs/tobacco profile. The nose is pretty nice, but the palate is fairly simple and thin. The finish is pleasant but not long. All in all, it\\'s an easy drinking and tasty bourbon, but isn\\'t remarkable in any way. That\\'s ok, as the price wasn\\'t too high as far as I could tell on the web. I\\'ll give it a **C+/B-** right at 80/100.\\n\\nEdit: fixed typo \\n',\n",

Let’s see what’s up!\\n\\n\\r  \\n**Weller Special Reserve**, Buffalo Trace, 90 proof - Sweet with some vanilla, oak, and cream soda on the nose.  Light, sweet, vanilla, and some oak on the palate with a short finish. I would not buy this again. It's not awful, but I can spend a few more dollas and get something I enjoy more.\\n\\n\\r  \\n**Four Roses Single Barrel,** Four Roses 100 proof - Floral, oak (with a bit of cedar in the background), spicy, and some raw walnut on the nose. Oak, rye spice, a bit of caramel, and vanilla on the palate with a nice moderate and slight spicy finish. I will buy this again. A 100 proof single barrel for $45...yeah.\\n\\n\\r  \\n**Early Times Bottled in Bond,** Brown-Forman, 100 proof - Peanut shells, chocolate, brown sugar, and some layered cherry on the palate with a finish that is on the shorter side but enjoyable. I will buy this again. A great mixer or sipper; hopefully the profile doesn't change with the 1792 distillate. \\n\\n\\r  \\n**1792 Bottled in Bond**, 1792, 100 Proof - Banana pudding, dry oak, and a light spice on the palate. Muddled fruit upfront, oak, a little leather, a bit of spice, and cashew on the palate with an oaky finish that has a hint of orange marmalade. I would not buy this again. Not bad, but other stuff I'd rather enjoy.  If you enjoy it, more for ya!\\n\\n\\r  \\nThese were nice to revisit after a while of not sampling.

It's a solid bourbon that is easily attainable at a reasonable price.  While it is no longer age stated, it's pretty clear that this isn't just a young bourbon as the oak does show through here.  I'm going to put it right on my line for bourbon that I like. \\n\\n**Overall Rating – 80** (as mentioned above this is my line between I bourbon that I enjoyed vs one that I didn't)\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n**Review #10 – 1792 Single Barrel (store pick from Crown Liquors)**\\n\\n**ABV** - 49.3%\\n\\n**Age Statement** - N/A \\n\\n**Purchased** - Crown Liquors \\n\\n**Other info** - This was a store pick that was labeled as their 7/12/16 barrel.  \\n\\n**Tasted** - Neat in a Glencairn after resting ~15 minutes\\n\\n**Nose** - This doesn't even seem related at all to the Small Batch described above. It's slightly less than 5 proof more than the Small Batch and yet it's completely different.  It definitely smells higher proof with more alcohol.  The biggest notes that come through here are bananas and creme brulee. \\n\\n**Taste** - Much thicker mouthfeel coming across on this one.  It's a little bit oily here and dry.  The bananas carry through on the palate and lots of oak shows up here as well.  The palate is definitely a lot less sweet than the nose showed. \\n\\n**Finish** - It definitely finished longer than the Small Batch, but it was nothing of note either.  Generously I could call this a medium-ish finish here.  There is a little bit of cinnamon that I picked up on the back end.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - This was a massive step up from the standard Small Batch.  While this was definitely a nice store pick this ultimately leaves me with a bunch of questions: How big is the barrel variation with this?, How different is this from the non-store picks of 1792 Single Barrel?, What could this have been if they bottled it was a Full Proof?  I really, really enjoyed this one.  The only thing that's holding it back is that it had a relatively weak finish here.\\n\\n**Overall Rating – 87** \\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n**Review #11 - 1792 Full Proof**\\n\\n**ABV** - 62.5%\\n\\n**Age Statement** - N/A \\n\\n**Purchased** - VA ABC \\n\\n**Other info** - No specific barrel info here \\n\\n**Tasted** - Neat in a Glencairn after resting ~15 minutes\\n\\n**Nose** - This came across with much more ethanol on the nose than the other two (and understandably so with the proof difference).  This was hitting a lot of the Small Batch notes (grass, cola, caramel), but turned up to 11.\\n\\n**Taste** - First thing that hit me was a wave of cherry.  This was followed by cola, oak, and caramel.  The palate was thinner than the Single Barrel.\\n\\n**Finish** - The longest finish of the bunch and it was dry with a nice tingle that stayed with me.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - This is a solid, enjoyable bourbon and a nice addition to the 1792 range.  I'm hopeful that a really nice store pick can really shine in this profile.  I like that there is a near barrel proof version out there although I think this one isn’t in the same class as Stagg Jr, ECBP, and Booker’s.\\n\\n**Overall Rating – 85** \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot /r/bourbon\\n\",\n",
       " 'Let’s dive into my thoughts on this Full Proof bourbon from Barton distillery. Rumored to be about 8.5 years, it has a mashbill of 75% corn, 15% Rye, and 10% Malted Barley. Runs roughly  between $50-$65 USD.⠀\\n\\n\\nNose:⠀\\n\\n\\nVery boozy with a good bit of that “nose hair sting”. Definitely had to let it sit in the glass for a bit and back the nose off some. On second examination there is a lot of that fruity cocktail and syrupy note to be found. Still very bold and a good bit of oak bitter/sweet sensation. Red hot cinnamon candy also appear. ⠀\\n\\n\\nPalate:⠀\\n\\n\\nFirst things first…yeah…this is hott lol. However, after you let your palate condition (which mind you took more than a few sips) you start to discover the fruity elements of this dram coupled with a lot of oaky tannin. The fruit that is there is syrupy; again what comes to mind is the juice left over from a fruit cup. Hot Cherry and cinnamon, peach and perhaps a hint of apple. It is quickly followed by hot oak and almost dusty tannin (maybe a tad to much ). The leather notes that show up are also slightly drying and bitter. Weirdly enough I don’t really get any kind of distinct vanillia. It does feel a bit out of balance. I feel it’s fighting with itself just a bit; Which, depending on my mood, I kinda like. A bit apple on the palate as well⠀\\n\\n\\nFinish: ⠀\\n\\n\\nLong and lingers hot cinnamon and oak on the tongue. Does start up pretty mouth coating and a tad fruit forward but then quickly turns more dry and boozy. As time goes on you almost feel like you have the after affect of an oak chip in your mouth. Again that dusty wood note shows up. ⠀\\n\\n\\nConclusion: 84.5 out of 100. ⠀\\n\\n\\nThis was a difficult one for me. I went back and forth on how I felt; which makes sense as again this dram feels like it’s slightly at war with itself. I’ll take a sip and it will be nice and fruity and then then the next is just hott and spice. It’s a lot of flavor but just not balanced. ⠀\\n\\n\\nIt’s a hell of a high proof in your face bourbon! For me, it felt and tasted a bit better after some water added. If you are a proof hound and like all the notes from above then I think for the price this is just for you⠀\\n\\n\\nCheers🥃',\n",

       " \"**Background:**  \\nOver the holidays I was able to find a bottle of 1792 Aged 12 Years and thought it’d be a fun idea to have a flight comparing it against the Small Batch and Full Proof. I was curious to see how the flavor profile would change with age and/or proof while also looking for possible commonalities between the three.   \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Small Batch**  \\n**Retail:** $29.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Honey  \\n**Proof and Age:** 93.7 proof with NAS (Rumored to be aged with barrels 6-9 years old)  \\n**Nose:** Ethanol is strong on the nose. Rye spice, vanilla, and creamier caramel notes appear after letting the bourbon breath.   \\n**Palate:** Rye spices make for a sharp palate upfront. Notes of caramel do break through mid-palate once the heat subsides, with hints of vanilla.   \\n**Finish:** Baking spices and alcohol result in a long finish that burns slightly. A stronger oak presence rounds out a drier finish.  \\n**Score:** 6.4/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Full Proof**  \\n**Retail:** $59.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Light Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 125 proof with NAS (Press release states an age around 8.5 years)  \\n**Nose**: Ethanol overwhelms the nose. However, strong caramel and banana notes do appear after a few minutes. When taking my first sip I detected a sweeter vanilla scent.   \\n**Palate:** An oily heat bombards upfront on the palate. However, it is not abrasive and the palate quickly evolved into a sweeter combination of vanilla and maple syrup. Strong notes of cinnamon were also present with a fruiter note towards the back of the palate that I’d describe as raisins. Brown sugar appears mid-palate after adding a few drops of water.   \\n**Finish:** Like the Small Batch, baking spices, white pepper, and alcohol create a lingering Kentucky Hug that burns and overpowers. Once the heat subsides dry charred oak notes take over, reminding me of times campfire smoke blows in my face.   \\n**Score:** 7.1/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Aged 12 Years**  \\n**Retail:** $69.99 in Wisconsin  \\n**Color:** Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 96.6 proof aged for 12 years  \\n**Nose:** The nose is not a punch like the Small Batch and Full Proof. Heavy brown sugar and caramel notes, along with vanilla and toffee, make this nose a sweet bomb. Hints of oak poke through, but are quickly covered up.   \\n**Palate:** Unlike the nose, the palate is relatively dry. Toasted oak is the main protagonist and decent legs allow it to encompass the palate. Towards the rear of the palate spicier cinnamon notes contrast with sweeter caramel to add some complexity to an otherwise one-dimensional palate.   \\n**Finish:** Similar to the palate, the finish is oak-forward and leaves a nice and mild Kentucky Hug. Baking spices and hints of cinnamon add to what is a very dry finish. However, unlike the Full Proof the oak has a bitter tannin taste.   \\n**Score:** 7.6/10  \\n🥃  \\n**Overall:**   \\nWhile these are three decent bourbons, each has a flaw that holds it back from being a great bourbon in my mind. While a solid bottom shelf bourbon, youthful nature of the Small Batch inhibits it from being anything other than a mixer in my eyes. The Full Proof had the most dimension on the palate and was quite enjoyable once the heat dissipated. However compared to other high-proof bourbons, the heat antagonized more subtle flavors, inhibiting it from being in the same category as an ECBP. My favorite of the three, the 12 year 1792 was smooth and lacked any heat, helping elevate it above the others. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional oak palate and finish lacked the complexity I was hoping for with an older bourbon. I feel sweeter marshmallow or vanilla notes would elevate this otherwise bland profile into a truly great bourbon. Overall, the biggest surprise was the prevalence of a drier oak finish for each bourbon. I’d like to hear what you all think of these bourbons and what you believe is the optimal proof or age for a 1792 bourbon.   \\n🥃 [PREVIOUS REVIEWS](https://www.facebook.com/oaknchar/) 🥃  \\n**Scoring:**   \\n1 - Better used as a fire starter or drain cleaner  \\n2 - Undrinkable, last resort where one sip is enough  \\n3 - Vulgar, painful to finish a pour and the bottle will probably gather dust  \\n4 - Indecent, would be average but something doesn't sit right   \\n5 - Average, run of the mill that goes well with a chaser  \\n6 - Decent, usually added into cocktails or on ice  \\n7 - Good, can drink straight without complaining   \\n8 - Great, something reserved for close family or friends  \\n9 - Excellent, something reserved for those special moments in life  \\n10 - Perfection, the precious to my Gollum\",\n",

       " '**Review #25- 1792 Full Proof**\\n\\n\\nThe next few reviews are of some pretty available bourbons that come in at pretty high proofs.   The first up is 1792 full proof.\\n\\n___\\n\\nI have always had a bit of a bug in my crawl about 1792 because where I am, retailers have to buy barrels of it if they want to receive an allocation of Pappy.  Retailers, in turn, have to offload that large amount of 1792.  As a result,  many locals here do a reward system where customers, even loyal ones have to buy cases of 1792 to get on the list to buy Pappy at well above MSRP.  I don’t participate at any level but it is a picture of the flawed distributor/ retailer system that just bothers me.  Moreover, for some reason every retailer here seems to pitch the line that “It beat Pappy in a competition” when I go into a store as a sales pitch.  Oy Vey.    \\n\\n\\nHowever, I have actually liked 1792 and other Barton products well enough to wonder what a “full proof” version would taste like.  Thanks to /u/mr899 for the sample.          \\n___\\n\\n\\n**1792 Full Proof (125 proof)**\\n\\n\\nEnjoyed neat in a Glencairn Glass rested for a quite a few minutes.  \\n\\n\\n**Nose:**  Almost like a sweet 51% rye.  I kept getting a sweet pine note.  A good deal of ethanol is present, bananas and caramel emerge after it has had quite a while to open up.   \\n\\n\\n**Palate**: cane sugar, bananas foster, caramel, dry cinnamon with some oak spice.    \\n\\n\\n**Finish:** a good deal of ethanol and pepper spice, Caramel lingers on the back of the palate.  Some leathery, almost medicinal notes hang around too but nothing too off putting.     \\n\\n\\n**Overall**,   Not a whole lot of complexity but also not a whole lot disagreeable.  This is a solid pour.  If I saw it in the 40’s, I’d buy it.  It drinks below it’s proof on the front end of the palate.  However, every time I swallowed, the heat showed up and I kept feeling the need to clear my throat.  That hot finish detracts from the enjoyability because it feels a bit unbalanced with the rest of the palate.      \\n\\n\\n**Update:**  I finished off this sample a day or so later.  This time more casually in a rocks glass.  It was far too hot for casual sipping.  So I added a splash of water and that made it more drinkable.  It lost its complexity and became a more one note (that note was pepper) drink.  Once again, glad to have tried it.  If I am in the mood for something different and challenging and it shows up, I might give it another whirl.  But I already have more highly preferred sippers and more highly preferred high proof bottles.  \\n\\n\\n**Score 84**/100       \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It\\'s certainly not the best but at $12 a bottle, it\\'s an outstanding value.

You can certainly smell the 125 proof as it\\'s pretty warm.\\n\\n**Taste:** Upfront it is just like the nose - a hot caramel banana vanilla ice cream sundae. Towards the finish some leathery and tobacco notes come in showing some slight oak complexity. This tastes just like what I would expect from more proof and extra aging of the bottled in bond \"6\" product. \\n\\n**Thoughts:** This is pretty good. I doubt you will find a better (mostly) barrel proof bottle of whiskey in this price range on the shelf today. But like the bottled in bond product it is not without its flaws. When I first opened the bottle I thought it was brutally hot for the proof and occasionally I get some harsh char or untamed ethanol.

       " 'Thanks to my friend Cliff for sharing a dram of this one.\\n\\nI missed all the hullabaloo about 1792 and the naming. So much so, that when I first posted, I kept in the part that they had to take out, what with the suing and the lawyers and hoiven-pretty lady!\\n\\nLook up Jerry Lewis\\' comedy if you don\\'t get that last part. Oh, and apologies if he too has done something horrible in the past that we only found out about in the future that was horrible. And apologies to his family for adding that in with no proof at this time of that at all.\\n\\nReally I love his comedy, that\\'s what I\\'m saying, and I\\'m using a joke. Then I\\'m overexplaining it because if I don\\'t, someone will be offended and I\\'ll get tweeted at.\\n\\nAlright, so I missed all the rough stuff and jumped right to the bourbon. Which makes me more privileged than normal, as I didn\\'t have bias to throw me off. Thus when I found out that **1792 Full Proof** was one of their limited editions, and being the kind of gent who thinks \"strongest booze is best booze\" in typical situations, I was excited.\\n\\nAnd when I had some sent to me by my buddy Cliff, I was even more excited. So this whiskey is the same proof as the entry proof of the spirit into the virgin cask. And if that doesn\\'t perk your ears, then we\\'re going to the park. Who wants to go to the park? You do, don\\'t you? Yeah!\\n\\nBut first, let\\'s see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** Kentucky\\n\\n**Abv:** 62.5%\\n\\n**Colour:** 7.5YR 5/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Butter, fresh coconut, white peach, peanut, tea biscuit, vanilla/oak\\n\\nBig nose on this one. Lot more brash than the single barrel was. Or Single Barrel. Can\\'t decide the name I should use.\\n\\nThere\\'s some dry notes, coconut, even some burnt flour in there. Water simmers it down, almost too much? Or perhaps that was the trade off, and this didn\\'t take water well, so they left it. None the less, water simplifies it a lot, with vanilla/oak being the main flavours that dominate.\\n\\n**Taste:** Caramel, carrot, hot, lemon funk, thyme\\n\\nHot. My buddy Cliff likes them hot (make your own jokes here) and this is that. Brash, lots of funk (which I love, though not used to them in bourbon) and some herbal notes.\\n\\nInteresting. I wish it had some of the interesting flavours from the nose rather than uppercutting me, though some may prefer this, and it\\'s certainly cheaper than jaw surgery (in the US).\\n\\n**Finish:** Coconut, cereal, brown butter, oak, sage, coffee\\n\\nLovely finish. Like some sort of high end coffee drink with alcohol. Nutty too, and borrows the best of both the finish and taste.\\n\\nNo joke there. It\\'s just lovely to sip on.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** An interesting, if dry nose, followed by a simple, brash, too strong taste, and then a finish that makes up for it all.\\n\\nReally at the end of the day, this bourbon does a lot of different things. So perhaps it\\'s great in that regard alone. For me it was good, better than the standard, fun to try, however I preferred the Single Barrel for being more balanced. This is a shotgun blast hitting everything, and the Single barrel is a well placed shot from a rifle by a Polish farmer who just wants the Russian army off his or her front lawn.\\n\\nNice to try, try before you buy.

Artificial strawberry, like in gum.\\n\\n* Finish, Full Proof: Turns a little sweeter here. Vanilla, cola, toast, and a little tobacco flavor. Medium length. \\n\\n* Finish, Port: Not very long. The artificial strawberry dominates. A little bit of tartness. \\n\\nConclusion: Not crazy about either of these. The full proof definitely has more flavor. I had high hopes for the port finish, because I love port finishes in scotch, but it was held back by the low proof and tasted artificial. I liked both better than the small batch, but that’s a fairly low bar. Wouldn’t turn down a drink of either, but also not something I’d seek out. \\n\\nBuy a bottle?

       " 'Hi everyone,\\n\\nHappy Valentine’s Day.\\n\\nFor my 69th American Whiskey review I have for your viewing pleasure, the BEST WHISKY IN THE WORLD. The entire world. ^accordingtoJimMurray…\\n\\nSeriously though, I remember liking the usual 1792 when I tried it before and I have my friend Mike to thank for bringing a sample of this back from the USA for me to try.\\n\\nHaving spent some time and done tastings with Mr Murray myself, I have to say that my opinion of him has dramatically improved. Though, he seems to like Bourbon and Rye a hell of a lot more than I do.\\n\\nIn his honour, I will be tasting this whisky after drinking a black coffee, not having garlic for a week and spitting the entire measure into a plastic cup…\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**1792 Full proof 62.5%**\\n\\n**Colour:** Bronze\\n\\n**Body:** Full\\n\\n**Nose:** Big nose. Complex and dry, spiced caramel, cinnamon, some apple and under ripe cherry, a little hint of wood smoke, all nicely balanced together and without a big alcohol hit.\\n\\n**Taste:** Silky and soft arrival, building with the grain and dry spices, lovely mouthfeel and good development through stronger spice and wood notes, very dry late in the development with a little chocolate.\\n\\n**Finish:** Long length. Caramel and spices again but stays really nicely with silky oils, a tad too dry for me though.\\n\\nJim Murray seems to like whiskies that are well put together and this is surely that. Self-assured, powerful and balanced. This is fantastic Bourbon, if a little dry for my tastes.\\n\\n**79/100**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n[Updated Distillery Rankings] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/p/distillery-rankings.html)\\n\\nAmerican Review #69\\n\\nWhisky Network Review #1010',\n",

It smells uncannily like a cafe latte. You get the sweetness that only comes from steamed milk along with fragrant and slightly bitter notes of coffee. There's a bit of caramel as well making for a very lovely nose. \\n\\n**Palate:** For being 62.5% ABV, it certainly does not come off as a ball of heat. The main note I get is of freshly made caramel peanut brittle. There's caramel sweetness, a bit of peanut, and even has a hint of bitterness that you get with the slightly burnt bits. A toasted vanilla note follows along with this. With some water, it gets sweeter and the slightly bitter notes go away but the flavor profile remains largely the same.\\n\\n**Finish:** Short but rather intense in flavor. Toasted oak, toasted vanilla, and a hint of burnt sugar get wrapped up into the few brief moments this lingers on the tongue.. \\n \\n**Conclusion:** I've had a few 1792's and each one seems to be different from the next. One was [bananas foster in a bottle](https://scotchandsheen.com/2019/10/31/1792-single-barrel-select-hyvee/), one was [liquefied sweet breads](https://scotchandsheen.com/2020/01/10/1792-sweet-wheat/), one tasted just like [a generic high-rye bourbon](https://scotchandsheen.com/2020/01/25/1792-bottled-in-bond/), and then you have this one where the nose smells of cafe latte and the palate is caramel peanut brittle. They're all good in their own different ways, but the nose on this one was intoxicating (literally). You got wafts of the steamed milk notes along with a rich, rich caramel with the bits of coffee here and there helping balance it out. The palate is pretty good on its own as well, especially after it gets watered down a little bit. The finish was an great, intense burst of flavor to wrap things up nicely.

Oranges, a deep, rich caramel note, mint, lots of black pepper, vanilla, a bit of barrel char. The best nose from a 1792 I’ve experienced. Reminds me of an E mashbill Four Roses.\\n\\n**Palate** - Rich caramel, vanilla, barrel char, lots of black pepper, mint, oranges. Deep, rich, bold, spicy flavors. Very full bodied.\\n\\n**Finish** - Barrel char - which gets maybe a bit strong here - black pepper, mint all become more prominent, with the sweet orange/caramel/vanilla notes. Long lasting.\\n\\nI’d say this is on par with your average Four Roses Private Selection (this is a compliment), but isn’t quite as good as a standout Four Roses. It does seem to be about the best Barton Distillery can do IMO, unless we’re counting some of that old Rye HIgh West got their hands on. I’m really going to enjoy the rest of this one, though the barrel char note that gets just a bit strong on the finish, and the fact that at times it brings a bit much heat keep me from giving this an A range score.\\n\\n**89**/100\\n',\n",

Fewer releases, not something I always had, and something I’m still learning about. Thus when a friend sent me a bottle of **1792 Full Proof Single Barrel Select - Midway Discount Liquors**, I was very intrigued. It was added to a future tasting.\\n\\nI’ve said it before, however, it bears repeating: The pic of a store is a reflection of the person’s tastes. Good picks? It takes a brand and elevates it.

Interesting, I like those things.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, cumin, wheat, oak, peach\\n\\nAlright, a ton of cinnamon. Time gives us some earth, and then... More cinnamon. This is cinnamon heavy.\\n\\nOh, and water brings out a ton of peach to line that up. Holy peach, there’s a peach and some peach. It’s Mario 2 up in here.\\n\\n**Finish:** Peach cobbler, carrot, burnt sugar, cinnamon\\n\\nThe finish is where we get more peach, some more cinnamon after water, and some burnt sugar. Just to change it up, but not too much.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Fuck You Peach and Cinnamon type of whiskey. Brash, strong, unbalanced. If that’s your thing, then it’s perfect. For all I know the people who shop normally at Midway love that. Or the picker loves that and was blown away by it.\\n\\nMyself? This is lacking some subtle aspects to it. At all. It’s a ton of spice and peach. It’s certainly drinkable, however I think there are other 1792 offerings I’d buy over it.

       " '**1792 FULL PROOF (PANTHER CREEK PICK - THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS)**\\n\\nI wasn’t a fan of the standard batched release of 1792 Full Proof (see review #2), but the step up provided by a quality store pick is more pronounced on this product than any other offering I’ve tried.\\n\\nAge: Appx. 7.5 years\\n\\nProof: 125\\n\\nMashbill: 75% Corn / 10% Rye / 15% Barley\\n\\n*NOSE:* On the nose you can tell its a high-proof pour, with notes of dusty hay and dried oak.\\n\\n*PALATE:* Sweet fruit (baked apple, stone fruit) and cream with a hug that steadily builds. Spiced tea and hints of lemon zest.  Baking spice and cinnamon (red hots) on the mid to finish.  Hints of banana (but not as much as you would expect from a Barton product).  Putting the pour on ice organizes the flavors a bit with the front coming in with oak that transitions into baked apple and then to a savory cornbread note.\\n\\n*FINISH:* Medium-long finish of spiced vanilla that dissipates into a substantial hug that lingers.\\n\\n*OVERALL:* This bottle hit me differently each time I poured it, often overpowering, but on occasion it was balanced and focused.  While I appreciate the flavor punch of a higher proofed product, the sweet spot for the 1792 line is closer to 100 proof if you intend to sip it neat (my personal preference).  That said, this is one of those pours I’ll put on ice and sip at regular intervals to get a front row seat at the flavors unveiling themselves (also a wonderful way to drink flavor-packed Booker’s releases).  \\n\\n*WHY TO BUY:* High proof, big flavor bottles are your jam and you don’t mind knocking around your palate a bit.\\n\\n*WHY TO PASS:*  You prefer more harmony between flavor and proof.  \\n\\n**SCORE: 7.5**\\n\\n____________________________\\n\\n**SCALE:**\\n\\n10 - Life Changing: Truly a special bottle to be sipped on important life events\\n\\n9 - Exceptional Bourbon: Reserved for your closest friends and bourbon nerds\\n\\n8 - Thinking Man’s (or Lady’s) Bourbon: A whiskey worth sipping slow and reflecting on the taste\\n\\n7 - Solid Sipper: A quality pour to sip and enjoy\\n\\n6 - Mixer / Standard Middle Shelf: What you would actually put in your old fashioned\\n\\n5 - Take to a party, leave there (claim “It makes a great old fashioned”)\\n\\n4 - Cooking Booze: Enriching a BBQ glaze or butter sauce is right in its wheelhouse\\n\\n3 - Take to a party, leave there (make sure no one saw you)\\n\\n2 - Garage Bottle: Take to garage and forget about it\\n\\n1 - Drain Pour (be sure to recycle bottle)\\n\\n**PAST REVIEWS**\\n\\n[*#25: Dickel 15 (“Old Dickel Rick” Roma Liquor Pick)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/rbzvqv/review_25_dickel_15_year_old_dickel_rick_roma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#24: Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof (Village Liquor)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/r1dpox/jack_daniels_single_barrel_barrel_proof_total/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#23: Rebel Distiller’s Collection (Total Wine Houston)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/qpnahb/review_23_rebel_distillers_collection_total_wine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#22: Blood Oath Pact No. 7*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/q7ilpl/review_22_blood_oath_pact_7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#21: Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/pu62ti/review_21_makers_mark_cask_strength/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#20: Stagg Jr. Batch 15*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/pca6sk/review_20_stagg_jr_batch_15/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#18 & #19: Bardstown Discovery Series #4 & #5*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/oy33bf/review_18_19_bardstown_discovery_4_5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#15, #16 & #17: Dickel Deep Dive: Blue Note 17yr; Barrell (Dickel) 14yr; Dickel 15yr*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/oowfx6/review_15_16_and_17_dickel_deep_dive_blue_note/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#14: The Senator Barrel Proof Straight Rye Whiskey (Winter 2020)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/ogeprn/review_14_the_senator_barrel_proof_straight_rye/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#13: Nulu Toasted Single Barrel Select (Justin’s House of Bourbon)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/o7b76f/review_13_nulu_toasted_single_barrel_select/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#12: Still Austin Cask Strength Bourbon Whiskey*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/o0qf59/review_12_still_austin_cask_strength_bourbon/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#11: Barrell Bourbon Private Release “Cherry Cola for Two”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/nsj1da/review_11_barrell_bourbon_private_release_cherry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#10: Catoctin Creek Barrel Select Rye - Black Swan (Skip’s Store Pick)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/npwiw5/catoctin_creek_barrel_select_rye_black_swan_skips/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#9: Nashville Barrel Company Batch 2 “A Duet of Ryes”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/nhuosb/review_9_nashville_barrel_company_batch_2_a_duet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[*#6, #7 & #8: Eli - ja - Trois!

       " \"Merry Christmas season; I hope you all are home enjoying great bourbon with your families.  Thanks for the discussion yesterday.  I'm not shocked to hear that most of you really like the MM46 CS.  I think the diversity of palates and what people like being so different is what makes this hobby fun! \\r  \\n\\r  \\nReview #8 is for a 1792 Full Proof store pick.  This is my first bottle from Barton, and have not tried any other of their expressions.   \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Distiller/Bottler:** Barton 1792  \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Mash Bill:** Undisclosed, but probably 75% corn, 15% rye, 10% malted barley \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**ABV/Proof:** 62.5 ABV; 125 Proof \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Age:** NAS; Said to be 8+ years \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Price:** $43.99; Paid $49 \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Availability:**  Harder to find?  Not the impossible to find Sweet Wheat, but not Small Batch available either.   \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Tasting:** I used a Glencairn glass with \\\\~2oz of bourbon.  Left to air 10 minutes.  Bottle was opened about a month ago.  This is my 2nd pour from the bottle.   \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Color:** Pale Amber \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Nose:** Full, Rich Vanilla, warm white cake. Very sweet with minimal ethanol.  Slight smokiness.  Maybe some cherry, which is generally hard for me to identify so it could be some other sweet red fruit.   \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Taste:** Salted Caramel.  Black berries.  A hard to describe “Funk”.  Drinks its proof, but is drinkable.  Good mouth feel.   \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Finish:** Long, warm finish.  Sweet cherry cough syrup.  Bitter Funk.  Some oak and peanut \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Overall:**  This is quite good, and a very different bourbon than I usually drink.  The funk sets it apart; not in a bad way but in a way that may alienate some drinkers.  The nose to me is right up there with ECBP.  That could be the proof, but it's really great.  The sweetness really balances well with the funk.  Not something that I’d keep in my bar at all times, but I’d probably get a bottle once a year.  \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Value:** Great at $45.  Wouldn’t pay more than $50.  Don’t hunt this one.  I’d probably try WT Rare Breed before getting another bottle of this.  \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**Rank:** 6/10 \\r  \\n\\r  \\nT8ke's scale: \\r  \\n\\r  \\n0 | Unscored | New Make Spirit or Personal Selection \\r  \\n\\r  \\n1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n3 | Bad | Multiple flaws. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n5 | Good | Good, just fine. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n6 | Very Good | A cut above. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n7 | Great | Well above average \\r  \\n\\r  \\n8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n9 | Incredible | An all time favorite \\r  \\n\\r  \\n10 | Perfect | Perfect\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m going to start this review with my usual Barton disclaimer: I like their products more than most other folks seem to. I don\\'t live in Kentucky so I don\\'t have easy access to the crazy bang for your buck products like Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond 6 year. What I do have access to here though is Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond \"6\" and at $12 a bottle, that is easily the best whiskey value my money can regularly buy. Given my fondness for that product, it\\'s been nice to see them branching out with quite a few special releases over the past couple of years - Port Finish, Sweet Wheat, Full Proof, and what we have here today, High Rye. I\\'m glad to see them pushing the envelope with different things but truth be told of all of those the High Rye sounded the least interesting to me. I personally didn\\'t seek it out but when a friend spotted a bottle and asked if I wanted it, my Barton heart strings were tugged and I caved.\\n\\n###**Review #228: 1792 High Rye**\\n\\n*No Age Statement; 47.15% ABV; $46*\\n\\n**Nose:** Tingly rye menthol spice, a fair amount of ethanol heat, and a very familiar banana note that I typically taste and smell in Barton products. \\n\\n**Taste:** Some caramel/vanilla/honey wood sweets up front, then some spicy rye tingle in the back. That youthful Barton banana note is heavy handed, kind of like banana runts candy. The finish is mostly oak and wood related sweet flavors. It has a little spice kick in the form of anise and spearmint but I\\'m not really picking up a heavy rye presence. \\n\\n**Thoughts:**  Of all the special release 1792 products, this one is my least favorite. It\\'s pretty close in quality to the regular 1792 small batch in terms of age / wood depth and I don\\'t think the high rye mashbill has added much of anything to make this special. It\\'s not a bad bourbon per se but I find it exceptionally boring and average at best. In this price range for a Barton product, Full Proof is a much better value or if you wanted to go with a better high rye bourbon, stick to Four Roses Single Barrel.\\n\\n**Rating: C**\\n\\n*Note that price is not considered when assigning a rating.

       " 'Whiskey Network Review #15  r/Bourbon Review #3\\n\\nInfo: This is my first 1792 bourbon, looked at it many times but never felt the need to pick one up, generally I don’t see much about 1792 on this sub which is my main source for recommendations. But this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/5whip4/1792_high_rye/ about the scarcity,  the fact that it is just sitting on the shelves at most of the local bottles shops and that was enough of an excuse to trigger my FOMO and pick up a bottle, here are the results as promised.\\n\\nPrice: 35.99 USD\\n\\nAppearance: Mahogany, guessing NCF\\n\\nNose:  Foremost are the rye spice notes (Caraway, fennel, slight dill and cinnamon), Sweet vanilla and caramel, cola, \\n\\nTaste: Rye spice right away, granny smith apple, Bavarian custard, toffee,  cola, a little hint of fudge and walnuts. It has a very nice oily mouthfeel and sticky legs in the glass thus I would guess it is NCF.\\n\\nFinish: A flash of cinnamon forward rye settles into a sweet vanilla\\n\\nConclusion: So this feels a bit of a rushed review, normally I like to have a few glasses, let the bottle sit with some headspace and try it again later and compare my notes to before, but I said I would post a review so here we are. I am still getting my feet wet in bourbon but I found that I really like rye (HW double rye my favorite thus far) the first couple sips and I get a big burst of rye, as I continue to drink the rye forwardness fades and the experience is much more about the vanilla and cola bourbon sweetness getting a little one dimensional the longer the glass lasts, honestly I am not convinced the mashbill is that much more rye heavy than Wild Turkey 101 which also boasts a high rye content, I do think that I prefer this to WT101 but just barely. This is a good bourbon and maybe I will buy it again in the future, but I am not going to venture out of my way to find it. \\n\\nRating: B (86)\\n\\nA+:  Perfection, how do I replace my blood with this! (95-100/100)\\n\\nA: Damn good, would love to always keep a bottle of this laying around at all times if I could afford to. (90-95/100)\\n\\nB: I like it, would buy the occasional bottle, or order the occasional glass, but there are others I prefer more. (80-89/100)\\n\\nC: Unremarkable but drinkable, right in the middle of the bell curve. (70-79/100)\\n\\nD: Mixer, I don’t want to drink it straight up.

However, as is typical with 1792, the base bourbon is pretty bland and uninteresting. It is smooth and unoffensive but nothing special. I wish this was done to a bourbon like Booker's, ECBP or RRSiB so the sweet would be balanced with the spicy bold bourbon character.

       " 'This was finished for 2 years in port barrels after an undisclosed amount of time in standard bourbon barrels. Always one to find an odd abv to bottle at (the standard 1792 is 93.7 proof if memory serves), this is bottled at 44.45% abv. Thanks to u/stolenprayers for the sample.\\n\\n**Nose** - Rather muted. I get strawberries and raspberries, barrel char, black pepper, with some caramel and roasted nuts in the background. Eventually I pick up an orange peel note (weird) as well.\\n\\n**Palate** - Very mild entry, with raspberries, honey, an artificial caramel note, and candied nuts, with an increasing earthy red winey note (as opposed to the berry notes - it’s kind of tannic) along with some black pepper as it develops. Silky, palate coating texture.\\n\\n**Finish** - The earthy red wine note picks up a bit here, with black pepper, tart raspberries, cinnamon, a little mint, the artificial caramel note, and some candied nuts.\\n\\nThe port notes kind of dominate here - I do get some of the more standard bourbon notes here, but this seems like it’s for someone who wishes bourbon was red wine. It is kind of tasty in a winey way, though the red winey notes kind of drown out the bourbon ones a bit. That said, I would enjoy a pour of this if someone offered, but given other options I think I would go with the other options.

       " '**Review #59: 1792 Port Finish**\\n\\nI tried the original 1792 early in my exploration of bourbon.  It left me highly disappointed.  It was like a blander, slighter hotter Buffalo Trace.  I almost gave it another go tonight, but decided to just stick with this port finished version.  I’ve been out the review writing game for a while, but I’ve kept up on experiencing the content.\\nThis is from Barton, 6 years or so I have read but the bottle says “many” years in new white oak before finishing for a 2 more years in used port barrels.  It has an ugly fake gold top and the way “1792” is printed is stupid.  Why is each number a different size? I’m a sucker for port finished things though so let’s see how this one does.  I bought this tonight, $42 American Imperial Credits of the Realm.  Almost went for the $11 bottle of Mellow Corn instead, or in addition.  There is always next weekend.     \\n\\n**44.45% ABV**\\n\\n* **Appearance:**  Tears take a while to form and get thick and take their sweet time rolling down the glass.  Color is amberish but not that dark or Port colored. \\n\\n* **Nose:**  Spicy Sweetness typical of Port finishing, cloves, raisins are front and center, some citrus and coconut comes through once the spice dissipates a bit.  Nice toasty oak overall along with vanilla AND chocolate!  It’s a twist cone.  It’s a nice sweet nose \\n\\n* **Taste:**  More bitter than I expect from the nose.  There is young/green oak, dark chocolate, hazelnuts, raspberries, and some pepper.  The sweet and bitter elements are a bit at odds.  Thin but oily mouthfeel.   \\n    \\n* **Finish:**  Short, weak, dry, but pleasant while it lasts.\\n\\nWell, this was fine for $40 and honestly a nice change of pace from more standard fair.  That being said while there isn’t anything majorly wrong with it I found the nose a touch sweeter than I usually like and the taste a bit of a mess.  The port doesn’t help much and may be better suited for finishing rye and scotch.  The slightly high rye content (15% ?) of this bourbon gave me hope…\\n\\nAgain, certainly not bad, but I was hoping for more.  If you like a sweet nose you will love this.\\n\\n**76/100**     \\n',\n",

I’ve been able to cut out potato chips, most chocolate bars, and even pop from my life after enjoying all of those things for a long time. But never peanut butter, even though I completely know I’m basically eating icing sugar on my bread.\\n\\nI enjoy chocolate. While yes, I don’t try to buy chocolate bars too often, I do enjoy a good quality chocolate and baked goods with chocolates.\\n\\nMix those together? You have the last chocolate candies I still get tempted enough to eat to the point of sadness and self-hate once all the tasty empty wrappers surround me like judging parents.\\n\\nThus when you tell me you’re going to take 1792, a whiskey that I’ve generally enjoyed, and finish it in a port cask, a finish that I’m a sucker for, I’m going to be happy to try it. It was aged in the traditional virgin casks prior to being given a finish for two years in ex-port wine casks.

Oddly no spice that I get from the standard small batch 1792. More of the port cask has gone to town.\\n\\nTime and a tiny bit of water give more of that char and cereal, though looking back at my previous review of 1792, I’m not finding many similarities.\\n\\n**Taste:** Plum/floral, brine, caramel, Smarties, bitter wood\\nSalted, floral caramel? Nice. At first. I do enjoy that mix, and I’m one of those people who does love that floral element in whisky.\\n\\nThat said, it gets quite sweet. There’s a cheap chocolate side here. Note I mean Canadian Smarties here, a thicker shelled M&M that has some floral and overtly sweet aspects.\\n\\nHear that? It’s a bunch of my fellow Canucks finding something else to complain about me. Eventually, there’s some bitter oak leftover, which sadly couldn’t be hidden by the finish.\\n\\n**Finish:** Brine, basil, maple syrup, dandelion\\n\\nHerbal and salty with some sweetness to it. Blind this finish may come off as a Canadian Whisky. However the final floral aspect ties it back, and it’s a bit bitter.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Very, very floral. Simply put, you buy this as a bourbon fan and you drink it to completely be different. It doesn’t act like bourbon and it doesn’t act like Scotch. If anything it acts like what I want from Canadian whiskies to go in.\\n\\nWas it a success? Debatable, really. I think they would have been happier with more butter/plum filled drams that remind you of pudding. Instead, we ended up with a unique thing.\\n\\nSo are you hunting down this limited edition? Probably if you’re a big fan of unique drams, unique bourbons, or just uniqueness in general. It’s not what I thought it would be, but I was still having fun with aspects of it.

       " 'I first tried 1792 a few years ago, when I first started dipping my toes into the whisky world. I knew I didn’t like it, but couldn’t tell you why; therefore, I have always passed over it whenever I was shopping for a new bottle. \\n\\nTwo things convinced me to buy this bottle recently: 1) A trip to 1792 and a taste straight from the barrel. It was an amazing experience, one I was completely unprepared for, since the taste was shockingly good; and 2) The fact that this single barrel offering from Cox’s Spirits was only $18.99, a solid $5 to $10 under what I have seen 1792 at before. Sold.\\n\\n93.7 Proof (46.85% ABV). Tasted neat, in a citation glass, while listening to some Eric Whitacre (*Sleep, Lux Aurumque, Cloudburst...*)\\n\\n**Color:** Medium to light amber from core to edge. The tears are thick and grasping, but turn spotty after a few minutes of trailing.\\n\\n**Nose:** There’s an immediate rush of the classic aromas, like toffee, butterscotch, and citrus; however, the more I nosed this, mint, grass, and tobacco leaf slowly began seeping out. Not punchy and weighty, but not simple, either. The longer it sat, the aromas became more specific: Peppermint, orange peel, grapefruit juice, pipe tobacco, tupelo honey. There is a slight artificial plastic note, just swimming around discreetly, though. \\n\\n**Mouthfeel:** Velvety but not too weighty. Not thin, but a medium-light feel. Slightly parching and grasping at the cheeks through the chew. Creamy after a minute or so chewing.\\n\\n**Palate:** Cool citrus and cucumber notes on the front of the tongue quickly turn to spice and sourdough bread, while sweet butter seems to infiltrate the rest of the palate. The rye is very noticeable high in the gums and cheeks, presenting not as spice and nuts (like in other high-rye bourbons) but more as a peppermint candy. The taste is fairly simple, though, and there isn’t a ton of flavor-morphing through the chew.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butterscotch and peppermint really strive on after the swallow, with a nice dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and even a bit of tobacco leaf in the back of the throat. But there’s more of a finish of texture than of flavor, as the creamed butter just continues to coat the palate. Really enjoyable, even if a little short.\\n\\n**Overall:** The nose on this is nice and complex, especially the longer it sat; unfortunately, the palate just didn’t live up to the nose-hype (new favorite term!) and the finish was a bit short. The honey and butter flavor, as well as the buttery finish, really made this dram for me, but points taken off for the plastic undertone on the nose. I can’t wait until there’s a cask-strength offering of this. The straight from the barrel taste I had at the distillery forced me to look at this bourbon with new eyes, and I am a fan. \\n\\n**Score: 83/100**\\n',\n",
       " 'The Barton Distillery is located in Bardstown, KY, but is not part of the bourbon trail as they are part of Sazerac\\'s corporate family (along with Buffalo Trace) - the upside being, tours are free :). Speaking of tours, the guide on mine said they take great care to make sure their spent mash doesn\\'t sit long (less than a day) before going in to the next batch, which contributes, according to her, quite positively to the taste of the bourbon.\\n\\n1792 is Barton\\'s higher end bourbon, their only other line being Very Old Barton, which is a great value bourbon btw. Anyway, the back label of this one claims \"Rich Flavor, Velvety\". As for my notes:\\n\\n**Nose** - Wood furniture/wood char are the most prominent, followed by peaches, plums, nectarines, caramel, some vanilla, and a bit of clove and nutmeg. Much more stone fruit than I\\'m used to in a bourbon. Something artificial or plasticky that fades, while the spices increase, with breathing.  \\n\\n**Taste** - Vanilla, honey and caramel at first, picking up the stone fruits as it develops.  A slight rubbing alcohol note here detracts just a bit...the rubbing alcohol note was much more prominent when I first opened the bottle, a few days later it is very much toned down. Medium body. \\n\\n**Finish** - Moderate, with maple syrup, peach, clove, a bit of pepper and nutmeg. A charcoal note lingers.\\n\\nAfter my first pour from this bottle, I was inclined to give it a score in the 70\\'s due to a prominent rubbing alcohol note. A few days after my initial pour, though, that is very much toned down so I can at least enjoy sipping this neat. It does have some different characteristics compared to most other bourbons I\\'ve had, especially with all the stone fruit, and the label claim about velvety texture is actually somewhat accurate.

       " 'Why review these two particular bourbons head-to-head? Well, beyond the fact that I happen to have a bottle of both in my possession, I always had the vague sense—maybe it was the similar bottle-shape, the similar price-point, the similar name, or the shared slightly unusual ABVs—that these two whiskeys were more-or-less in direct competition for a certain segment of the market. When I actually started looking into things, I came to discover that the 1792 was originally called “Ridge*wood* Reserve” and that Brown-Forman (makers of Woodford) sued Barton on the grounds of its similarity to their own flagship bourbon. So, apparently the sense of competition wasn’t just in my head. But are they alike in flavour? And which is the better whiskey? On we go:\\n_____________________\\n**1792 Ridgemont Reserve Barrel Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**; 8 years old; proudly proclaiming itself to be ‘small batch’; produced by Barton (which is owned, like Buffalo Trace, by Sazerac); 46.85% ABV (93.7 proof); 750mL; retails for about $54 Cdn. in the province of Alberta, but I stumbled my way into a 20% discount on a customer appreciation day.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Burnished/chestnut? Pretty nice, glass-coating legs. The bottle, for what it’s worth, is friggin’ gorgeous.\\n\\n**Nose:** I’ve heard rumblings that 1792 is unique for having a fairly high barley content in its mashbill. I’m not sure how that would figure in the finished project, but there’s certainly something fairly unique here. Creamy custard, light banana. Vanilla, obviously. Light oranges. There’s a real pleasant almost graininess to it? Some chocolate. Fairly assertive rye spiciness, a very outdoorsy, rural sort of rye/grain/agricultural quality. Dry wood. Light hints of baking spice. A bit of brown sugar. Over time, the freshness of the vanilla really jumps out, as does the orange and banana. Light maple syrup, and a heavenly caramel character after about 25 minutes. But I’m really digging that creamy custard note. \\n\\n**Taste:** Oily initial, and yet still a certain sense of weaker body than you’d expect at 46+%. Fairly hot on the mouth. That creamy custard/vanilla note comes through, but there’s a bit of sourness here that’s not quite ideal (though it thankfully fades). Pretty muscular rye spice. Citrus. Chocolate or hazelnut. Dry wood. Not overly sweet. Fairly dry, in fact. Something vaguely Scotch-y in the mid-to-back of the mouth that’s hard to articulate (like a light Speyside or Highland), perhaps a kind of barley sugar quality?\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium. Some dryness. Wood. Citrus (again, orange). There’s that custard still. A bit of off sourness.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** Pretty unique. Time helps this one (the bottle has really grown on me), and the nose is really, really great, but the rest of the package doesn’t quite follow through (still good, though, don’t get me wrong). But damn, that custard! Also strikes me as a bourbon that would be great in cocktails.\\n\\n**Score:** 84\\n\\n_________________________\\n**Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**; no age statement; batch #161, bottle #6777; produced by Labrot & Graham (who are owned by Brown-Forman); 45.2% ABV (90.4 proof); 750mL; retails for about $49 Cdn. in the province of Alberta, but this particular bottle was a gift.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Ever-so-slightly lighter than the 1792, perhaps burnished. Good legs, though a bit less body than the 1792. The bottle/branding on this one is also very nice, though I think the 1792 wins for aesthetics.\\n\\n**Nose:** Banana is the big one here (either over- or under-ripe). Seems thin, somehow, which is a weird thing to observe on the nose. Something sort of herbal/vegetal. Sort of a musty quality? Faint diacetyl (buttered popcorn). Significant green apple. Oak, but light. A bit of sharp alcohol vapour. A mineral, granite or flint-like sort of quality. Hazelnuts. Cocoa powder. Grapes (or grappa, I guess?). Distant BBQ pork, or at least some BBQ sauce? Maple syrup. A bit of butterscotch or toffee.\\n\\n**Taste:** Green apples, cooked with cinnamon. Light body and mouthfeel, a decent bit of heat. Dry wood and barrel char. Brown sugar. Maple syrup. Fairly simple, enjoyable—not overly sweet, but not overly spicy or bitter, either.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium. Fairly dry. Lingering heat. Woody tannins, some green apple for a good long chunk of time. Yeasty, like someone snuck in a bit of Beam (something herbal, or vegetal)?\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** Another one that would probably do well in cocktails. Not my favourite, but certainly not a bad whiskey, and worth trying for the way it seems to get away from some of the stereotypical ‘bourbon’ notes. At the price they’re asking, though . . .\\n\\n**Score:** 82\\n\\n_______________________\\n**The Verdict:** They’re not really all that alike in character (aside from both being fairly unusual interpretations of ‘bourbon’), but 1792 Ridgemont Reserve wins this one hands down. Neither whiskey is perfect, and my feeling is that both are quite overpriced for what they are (especially up here in Canada, and especially the Woodford), but the Ridgemont is more unique, more muscular (in terms of flavour, body, and ABV), and its nose (especially as it opens) is just hands-down great, whatever other shortcomings it may have.\\n',\n",

Quick legs on the glass\\n\\n\\n**Nose**\\n\\nNot boozy at all. Vanilla and caramel, but with a damp musty aroma, earthy in a way, like a stone cellar. Licorice, some spice but not much. Decent nose overall\\n\\n**Taste**\\n\\nSpice but very fleeting. Hints of the vanilla and caramel and licorice, but again the sweet doesnt last much longer than the spice. Can taste that damp musty aroma, and it kind of reminds me of like a wet stone aftertaste. Not that I spend a whole lot of time sucking on rocks or anything... Not very impressed with the taste of this one. Ive had better.\\n\\n**Finish**\\n\\nThis section will be short and leave you wanting, just like the finish of the bourbon. It was very smooth, but with not a whole lot of taste (to me) there was even less of a finish. It came and it went and that was all there was to it. The spice disappears before it hits you and the sweet never really made itself known in the first place.\\n\\n*Score*\\n64/100\\n\\n*Overall* \\ni was excited to try this one, and it was a fairly inexpensive pour so at least there's that, but I was disappointed by this. I'll definitely try it again sometime to see if maybe I just got a bad pour or what happened, and I'd like to try it out of a glencairn not an ale snifter but that was all the bar had besides rocks glasses. \\n\\n*Grading Scale*\\n\\n95-100: Outstanding pour, will buy another bottle asap. Perfect\\n\\n90-95: Damn good pour, I'm smitten\\n\\n85-90: Still a very good Pour, will definitely grab another when its empty\\n\\n80-85: Pretty solid pour, everyday drinker depending on value\\n\\n75-80: Eh, still drinkable but not in any hurry to get another\\n\\n70-75: Share it with friends who pretend to like whiskey\\n\\n65-70: Not worth the money in my opinion\\n\\n65 and below: probably not going to finish this.

I have not seen this bottle in any recent trips through a handful of Binny's stores.\\n\\nBarton revamped their product line earlier this year, retiring this particular expression.

I may now be on the bandwagon about dropping age statements, if *this* is what happens.  In my view, it’s probably not worth taking the risk on this now, when I can get something more reliable like EC12, Bulleit, or WT101 at around the same price.  This bottle has actually been sitting around for a while — to be honest, I like it more now than I first did, when the rubber and plastic were even more pronounced.  \\n\\nReview # 39',\n",
       " 'When I did the Bourbon Trail last spring I didn’t know much about the Barton Distillery, after the tour it became a favorite of mine.  The distillery itself is no-frills compared to others and to me offered a truer industrial look at mass bourbon making.  They also make pretty good stuff, Very Old Barton is a steal for the price and this widely available small-batch is a nice bourbon also.  \\n\\n\\n**1792 Ridgemont Reserve**\\n\\n\\n**Setting:** After work in my home office. Poured into glencairn glass, a few drops of water added.\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Dark amber with slight golden hue.\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** Rich caramel custard, faint maple, old wood, apple, orange peel, rye spices, vanilla.\\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Spicy (cinnamon, pepper, slight mint), very oaky, honey, char, dried fruit (raisins, apricots).\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Medium.\\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Oaky, spicy, leather, faint salt and some residual burn.\\n\\n\\n**Score: 86/100**\\n\\n\\nThis bourbon is heavy on spice and oak notes but since those are some of my favorite notes I rate this higher.  The spice notes aren’t as strong if you don’t add water.  This bottle still has the 8 year statement hidden on the back and its interesting 93.7 proof (46.85% ABV, how precise!).  Also the burlap strip around the top acts as a nice drip catcher.  Overall as the easy to find Barton bourbon (for me anyways in MD), I keep a bottle around the house.  I bet it tackles an old fashioned real nice.  I’ve had other bottles and the last one would have rated an 88, it had more balance so there’s some bottle variation I think.

And for me, that means catching up on reviews this week.\\n\\nHowever before I do that, I'll be reviewing **1792 Ridgemont Reserve**, which I purchased for my father for his Birthday. Because I'm a good son (also because I can try some of it).\\n\\nLet's go with the whole 'good son' thing, makes me sound better.\\n\\nAnyway, this bourbon used to carry a small batch 8 year moniker, however has since dropped the age statement and become NAS. Which is too bad. It may still be good, however time will tell. \\n\\nThe name 1792 is the year that Kentucky became a state. Many bothans were lost that day.\\n\\nIt also used to be called Ridgewood Reserve 1792, however Brown-Forman sued Barton to have the name changed, because they felt that it was too much like Woodford Reserve's name... so they moved the numbers to the front and removed the word wood.\\n\\nThat's show'em...Even as I'm typing that, it hurts. Could have spent that money on keeping the age statements instead...Or, I don't know, not thinking people will read 3/4 of your name and get it mixed up?\\n\\nAnyway, I'm interested to try this whiskey.

Sweet, notes of nice desserts, and goes well with the heat wave we've been having.\\n\\nThe name may be throwing off the nose though... oh wait, it's not, because I'm not a moron.\\n\\n**Taste:** Hot, caramel, cumin, cilantro, ginger\\n\\nVery hot. Holy jumping that's hot. Maybe I didn't leave it long enough. \\n\\nHad to take extra time on this one, because I was confused about the name. Oh wait, no I wasn't. I had to because I was icing cakes before having this one, and had to get the taste of Nutella icing out of my mouth.\\n\\nYour sympathy is palpable through the screen.\\n\\nAnyway, this is quite hot. I was able to pick out some earth/grassy/leafy notes as well, and a good amount of ginger.\\n\\n**Finish:** Corn, peach, lemon, arugula, radish, candy cane\\n\\nFinish is better developed than the taste. I say that's the name causing it.\\n\\nIt's earthy, minty, and has some nice fruity elements.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is a nice sipper. Can we change the name though? Something more woody?\\n\\nMoving on...\\n\\nIt's smooth, not too offensive, and the finish and nose have nice flavours to them. I wish there was a little more to the taste. All in all, nice to sip on, a little too pricey in Ontario to buy just for that. Still worth it though.\\n\\n**77/100**\\n\\n*Bourbon review #71, Kentucky review #48, Whiskey Network review #512*\\n\\n*1001 Whiskies to taste before you die review #241*\\n\",\n",

Be kinda a dick move.\\n\\n**1792 Ridgemont Reserve Single Barrel** is a bit different for a single cask. While yes, there are various stores that have obtained their own single casks with their name on them of this very whiskey, **1792 Ridgemont Reserve Single Barrel** was released as a limited edition in the same vein as Sweet Wheat. So this is not selected by a store, and is more close to E.H. Taylor Single Barrel.\\n\\nThe company makes this straight bourbon the same as 1792; with a high-rye composition. They then select the finest barrels, and bottled them individually. There's nothing stating which barrel this was, which I think Barton 1792 Distillery should consider in the future.\\n\\nGranted perhaps that's to avoid people hunting down a specific, better barrel.\\n\\nLet's see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** $49 USD (In New York)\\n\\n**Abv:** 49.3%\\n\\n**Region:** Kentucky\\n\\n**Colour:** 10YR 7/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet corn, oak, cotton candy/birthday cake, dill\\n\\nNice strength to this.

Not as sweet as the nose, luckily. A lot more balanced and salty on the taste. Nice to sip on.\\n\\n**Finish:** Edamame, ginger, wheat, Werther's, corn\\n\\nMore umami, less sweet, it's calmed the sweetness down at the end to a more traditional (but strong) caramel note. Each flavour flairs up individually.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Some alcohol to this one, it takes a little dab of water quite nicely. Initially quite sweet, luckily it's more balanced on the taste and finish. Each flavour was nicely punchy, however no one flavour takes over for too long.\\n\\nI liked this one, and give myself a pat on the back for getting it for my dad.

It's pleasant and pretty light at the same time.  I pick up notes of grass, cola, and caramel.   \\n\\n**Taste** - A little bit of caramel along with a nice touch of oak here.  There was some fruit here but it was very tough for me to put a finger on it (maybe orange rind).   \\n\\n**Finish** - The finish is pleasant enough, but it's fairly short here.  There is a little tingle, but it fades pretty quickly.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - I like this bourbon.  I would describe this as a fairly simple bourbon, but nothing outstanding.  It's a solid bourbon that is easily attainable at a reasonable price.  While it is no longer age stated, it's pretty clear that this isn't just a young bourbon as the oak does show through here.  I'm going to put it right on my line for bourbon that I like. \\n\\n**Overall Rating – 80** (as mentioned above this is my line between I bourbon that I enjoyed vs one that I didn't)\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n**Review #10 – 1792 Single Barrel (store pick from Crown Liquors)**\\n\\n**ABV** - 49.3%\\n\\n**Age Statement** - N/A \\n\\n**Purchased** - Crown Liquors \\n\\n**Other info** - This was a store pick that was labeled as their 7/12/16 barrel.  \\n\\n**Tasted** - Neat in a Glencairn after resting ~15 minutes\\n\\n**Nose** - This doesn't even seem related at all to the Small Batch described above. It's slightly less than 5 proof more than the Small Batch and yet it's completely different.  It definitely smells higher proof with more alcohol.  The biggest notes that come through here are bananas and creme brulee. \\n\\n**Taste** - Much thicker mouthfeel coming across on this one.  It's a little bit oily here and dry.  The bananas carry through on the palate and lots of oak shows up here as well.  The palate is definitely a lot less sweet than the nose showed. \\n\\n**Finish** - It definitely finished longer than the Small Batch, but it was nothing of note either.  Generously I could call this a medium-ish finish here.  There is a little bit of cinnamon that I picked up on the back end.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - This was a massive step up from the standard Small Batch.  While this was definitely a nice store pick this ultimately leaves me with a bunch of questions: How big is the barrel variation with this?, How different is this from the non-store picks of 1792 Single Barrel?, What could this have been if they bottled it was a Full Proof?  I really, really enjoyed this one.  The only thing that's holding it back is that it had a relatively weak finish here.\\n\\n**Overall Rating – 87** \\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n**Review #11 - 1792 Full Proof**\\n\\n**ABV** - 62.5%\\n\\n**Age Statement** - N/A \\n\\n**Purchased** - VA ABC \\n\\n**Other info** - No specific barrel info here \\n\\n**Tasted** - Neat in a Glencairn after resting ~15 minutes\\n\\n**Nose** - This came across with much more ethanol on the nose than the other two (and understandably so with the proof difference).

       " \"This week Oak Liquor Cabinet got in the long awaited series of 1792 picks including a Single Barrel, Bottled in Bond and Full Proof. I've been a fan of the Oak picks in the past and of 1792 in general so I was pretty excited and wanted to get them all in one go. I tasted all of these neat, side by side after ~5 minutes of resting.\\n\\n## Review\\n**Age**: All NAS\\n\\n**Abv**: 98.6, 100, 125 proof\\n\\n**Color**: A medium amber\\n\\n### SiB\\n**Nose**: Sweet caramel and baking spice with a touch of citrus\\n\\n**Taste**: A little thin with more caramel and citrus notes and a touch of acetone. \\n\\n**Finish**: Slightly harsh but decent length with warm spice\\n\\n**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+\\n\\n### BiB\\n**Nose**:  A less distinct nose with a more generic sweetness probably vanilla and caramel notes\\n\\n**Taste**: Nice mouthfeel with warm spice, vanilla and caramel. Just a hint of oak\\n\\n**Finish**: Long and warm with a nice spice balanced with some oak\\n\\n**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf\\n\\n### FP\\n**Nose**: A rich sweet vanilla caramel with a bit of spice\\n\\n**Taste**: An amazing mouthfeel with a bold sweet vanilla and baking spice palate with hints of oak and caramel\\n\\n**Finish**: Long and lingering with warm spice and sweet vanilla and a little burn\\n\\n**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIt was a lot of fun getting to try all three of these side by side and compare with my old write ups on the [Single Barrel](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/30/Review-22-1792-Single-Barrel/), [Bottled in Bond](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/10/27/Review-34-1792-Bottled-in-Bond/) and [Full Proof](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/09/24/Review-19-1792-Full-Proof/).\\n\\nOverall I got a lot of the same notes from these 3 and their regular variants, which doesn't surprise me, but the proportions of those notes, the heat and the mouthfeel are all very different. I personally preferred the BiB which doesn't surprise me since I did this tasting neat. I imagine with a bit of cold water or ice the FP would nudge ahead. The Oak Liquor Cabinet FP is a bit better than the standard, the BiB is a significant step up as is the SiB. I really like the regular FP and BiB but don't particularly care for the regular SiB. This is another great set of picks by Oak Liquor Cabinet.\\n\\nYou can also read [this](https://atxbourbon.com/2018/12/19/Reviews-51-53-Oak-Liquor-Cabinet-1792-Picks/) and my other reviews at [atxbourbon.com](http://atxbourbon.com) or follow me on [Instagram(@atxbourbon)](https://www.instagram.com/atxbourbon/) to keep up with these reviews and my other whiskey-centric adventures.\\n\\n\\n## Scale\\nMy reviews are mostly about taste but occasionally take price into consideration generally dropping a point from whiskies in the 8-9 range that seem significantly more expensive than similar quality bottles.\\n\\n**10** - a unicorn, I haven't found it yet\\n\\n**9** - a favorite that I almost always have a bottle of on my shelf\\n\\n**8** - an excellent bottle I'd be happy to buy\\n\\n**7** - a solid whiskey I'd happily order at bar if they don't have something 8+\\n\\n**6** - a decent whiskey that I don't prefer but don't avoid and would be fine having as a mixer or in a pinch somewhere with a poor selection\\n\\n**5** - I would drink it if offered and I didn't have to pay for it\\n\\n**4** - Fine as a mixer, bring on the Coke Zero\\n\\n**3** - Maybe a mixer if I'm in  pinch\\n\\n**2** - no thanks\\n\\n**1** - pouring out the bottle  \",\n",

Lots and lots of caramel, some maple syrup, and then banana cream pudding. Smells delicious.\\n\\n**Palate:** Medium mouth feel. It tastes absolutely like bananas foster in a bottle. You get bananas, brown sugar, a bit of toasted sugar, some vanilla, cinnamon, and a tiny hint of pecan.\\n\\n**Finish:** The finish is a bit on the short side. That little bit of toasted sugar is there along with a bit of vanilla.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** With all of the craze about 1792 whiskey lately, I figured I should give one a try. This bottle is one from their Single Barrel Select line with the barrel picked out and bottle for HyVee here in the Midwest. DanZ remarked to me on Discord that it’s “legit banana in a bottle” and he was pretty spot on! It starts off with a really delightful nose that had my wife very happy with some banana cream pudding notes along with caramel and maple syrup. The palate is absolutely full of banana and some spices making me really think of a bananas foster. A little bit of creaminess is probably all that’s missing to make that analogy really work. The finish could be a bit longer but I do like the toasted sugar and vanilla that is in it. All in all, a tasty whisky but if you don’t like bananas I’d say try before you buy. Would I buy another bottle? Probably.\\n\\n**Final Score:** 80.\\n\\n*American Whiskey review #13, Bourbon Whiskey Review #11, Whisky Network Review #149*\\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Scoring Legend:**\\n\\n* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods.\\n\\n* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky.\\n\\n* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible).\\n\\n* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here.\\n\\n* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink.\\n\\n* 70-74: Solid, wouldn't go out of my way to get it.\\n\\n* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable.\\n\\n* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of my whisky reviews and reviews of whatever else I think of can be found over on my [blog]( https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/).\",\n",
       " 'Technically, I’ve [already reviewed](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1l1070/a_headtohead_review_s_19_20_woodford_reserve_vs/) this bourbon.\\n\\nBut I’m going to review it again, because in the intervening years, two things have happened: one, its age statement has been dropped (it was 8 years, but no longer), and two, it has undergone an almost total rebranding—a name change and a labelling change. What was 1792 Ridgemont Reserve has become 1792 Small Batch (a rebranding that is intended to signal that this whiskey will be joined by others shortly in a broader “1792” line-up: as I understand it, at some point we’re supposed to see a single barrel, a barrel proof, and a wheated bourbon).\\n\\n**1792 Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**; made at Sazerac’s 1792 Barton facility (Bardstown, KY); no age statement; 46.85% ABV (93.7 proof); 750mL; retails for about $55 Cdn. in Alberta, Canada.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Deep copper? Burnished. Surprisingly dark. Decent legs. And though I went back and forth on it at first, I actually dig the rebranding, aesthetics-wise. I like the gold/red combo, and am totally okay with dropping that weird fabric thing around the neck of the old bottle. (Also, ignore the photo because I *did* taste this from a glencairn. I just like that particular rocks glass)\\n\\n**Nose:** This is the 1792 I remember. Custard and bananas. Lots of custard and bananas. Some cinnamon and baking spice, quite a bit more singe on the nostrils than I’d expect from a premium offering. Mint, vanilla. Rye bread. Raw sugar? Barrel char. Faintly medicinal or herbal. Licorice? Light toffee. Slight mango? Almost malty and scotch-like (I’ve heard Barton uses more barley than most US distilleries in its mashbill)? Very similar to what I recall of its precursor. \\n\\n**Taste:** Again, similar to my recollections. Hotter than I expected, and thinner, too. Quite hot. Light cherry liqueur at first. Bitter citrus pith (grapefruit). A pretty dry bourbon, aside from an initial hit of sweetness right at the beginning of the sip. Custard, a touch of banana. Toasted wood, vanilla, a bit of butterscotch. Dry maple syrup, if that makes sense? Maybe maple tree sap? Baking spices playing around in the background. Peppery throughout. Orange. Herbal, medicinal. A bit of caraway and clove? That really rich, intense custard I remember from the earlier version (one of that version’s selling points) seems to me really muted here, which is disappointing.\\n\\n**Finish:** Dry. Wood char, barrel flavour. Yeasty? Herbal. Menthol. Slightly sour. Not a great finish. Very . . . rustic?\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** I didn’t go back to my notes for the earlier version until I completed my tasting of the new bottling. Looking at them now, it seems there are a lot of similarities (as there should be, since it’s essentially the same juice, minus an age statement). But—and this is as likely to be my palate developing as a substantive change in the whiskey—there are some aspects here that I’m not super happy about: the finish isn’t great, the taste is way hotter and more alcohol-forward than it should be at this ABV, and I’m not crazy about the front-to-back *dryness* of this spirit (aside from the initial hit of sweetness on the tongue, there’s a lot of dryness, a lot of bitterness). Honestly, this is only marginally better than Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond. Decent but disappointing.\\n\\n**Score:** 81\\n',\n",
       " \"Ummm, so if I'm reading this right, the yellow necked bottle on the left is the second commented on (100pf) that you enjoyed it so much you went thru it before realizing it.  FYI, did you also not realize that it was actually a store pick of 1792BIB (Bottled in Bond) and not Small Batch (maroon neck)?  That's why you went thru it so quick, it's a really good 1792 variety (the best IMHO although I've yet to find a bottle of 12yr).\",\n",

It's pleasant and pretty light at the same time.  I pick up notes of grass, cola, and caramel.   \\n\\n**Taste** - A little bit of caramel along with a nice touch of oak here.  There was some fruit here but it was very tough for me to put a finger on it (maybe orange rind).   \\n\\n**Finish** - The finish is pleasant enough, but it's fairly short here.  There is a little tingle, but it fades pretty quickly.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - I like this bourbon.  I would describe this as a fairly simple bourbon, but nothing outstanding.  It's a solid bourbon that is easily attainable at a reasonable price.  While it is no longer age stated, it's pretty clear that this isn't just a young bourbon as the oak does show through here.

It's slightly less than 5 proof more than the Small Batch and yet it's completely different.  It definitely smells higher proof with more alcohol.  The biggest notes that come through here are bananas and creme brulee. \\n\\n**Taste** - Much thicker mouthfeel coming across on this one.  It's a little bit oily here and dry.  The bananas carry through on the palate and lots of oak shows up here as well.  The palate is definitely a lot less sweet than the nose showed. \\n\\n**Finish** - It definitely finished longer than the Small Batch, but it was nothing of note either.  Generously I could call this a medium-ish finish here.  There is a little bit of cinnamon that I picked up on the back end.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - This was a massive step up from the standard Small Batch.  While this was definitely a nice store pick this ultimately leaves me with a bunch of questions: How big is the barrel variation with this?, How different is this from the non-store picks of 1792 Single Barrel?, What could this have been if they bottled it was a Full Proof?

       " \"**Background:**  \\nOver the holidays I was able to find a bottle of 1792 Aged 12 Years and thought it’d be a fun idea to have a flight comparing it against the Small Batch and Full Proof. I was curious to see how the flavor profile would change with age and/or proof while also looking for possible commonalities between the three.   \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Small Batch**  \\n**Retail:** $29.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Honey  \\n**Proof and Age:** 93.7 proof with NAS (Rumored to be aged with barrels 6-9 years old)  \\n**Nose:** Ethanol is strong on the nose. Rye spice, vanilla, and creamier caramel notes appear after letting the bourbon breath.   \\n**Palate:** Rye spices make for a sharp palate upfront. Notes of caramel do break through mid-palate once the heat subsides, with hints of vanilla.   \\n**Finish:** Baking spices and alcohol result in a long finish that burns slightly. A stronger oak presence rounds out a drier finish.  \\n**Score:** 6.4/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Full Proof**  \\n**Retail:** $59.99 in Minnesota  \\n**Color:** Light Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 125 proof with NAS (Press release states an age around 8.5 years)  \\n**Nose**: Ethanol overwhelms the nose. However, strong caramel and banana notes do appear after a few minutes. When taking my first sip I detected a sweeter vanilla scent.   \\n**Palate:** An oily heat bombards upfront on the palate. However, it is not abrasive and the palate quickly evolved into a sweeter combination of vanilla and maple syrup. Strong notes of cinnamon were also present with a fruiter note towards the back of the palate that I’d describe as raisins. Brown sugar appears mid-palate after adding a few drops of water.   \\n**Finish:** Like the Small Batch, baking spices, white pepper, and alcohol create a lingering Kentucky Hug that burns and overpowers. Once the heat subsides dry charred oak notes take over, reminding me of times campfire smoke blows in my face.   \\n**Score:** 7.1/10  \\n🥃  \\n**1792 Aged 12 Years**  \\n**Retail:** $69.99 in Wisconsin  \\n**Color:** Copper  \\n**Proof and Age:** 96.6 proof aged for 12 years  \\n**Nose:** The nose is not a punch like the Small Batch and Full Proof. Heavy brown sugar and caramel notes, along with vanilla and toffee, make this nose a sweet bomb. Hints of oak poke through, but are quickly covered up.   \\n**Palate:** Unlike the nose, the palate is relatively dry. Toasted oak is the main protagonist and decent legs allow it to encompass the palate. Towards the rear of the palate spicier cinnamon notes contrast with sweeter caramel to add some complexity to an otherwise one-dimensional palate.   \\n**Finish:** Similar to the palate, the finish is oak-forward and leaves a nice and mild Kentucky Hug. Baking spices and hints of cinnamon add to what is a very dry finish. However, unlike the Full Proof the oak has a bitter tannin taste.   \\n**Score:** 7.6/10  \\n🥃  \\n**Overall:**   \\nWhile these are three decent bourbons, each has a flaw that holds it back from being a great bourbon in my mind. While a solid bottom shelf bourbon, youthful nature of the Small Batch inhibits it from being anything other than a mixer in my eyes. The Full Proof had the most dimension on the palate and was quite enjoyable once the heat dissipated. However compared to other high-proof bourbons, the heat antagonized more subtle flavors, inhibiting it from being in the same category as an ECBP. My favorite of the three, the 12 year 1792 was smooth and lacked any heat, helping elevate it above the others. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional oak palate and finish lacked the complexity I was hoping for with an older bourbon. I feel sweeter marshmallow or vanilla notes would elevate this otherwise bland profile into a truly great bourbon. Overall, the biggest surprise was the prevalence of a drier oak finish for each bourbon. I’d like to hear what you all think of these bourbons and what you believe is the optimal proof or age for a 1792 bourbon.   \\n🥃 [PREVIOUS REVIEWS](https://www.facebook.com/oaknchar/) 🥃  \\n**Scoring:**   \\n1 - Better used as a fire starter or drain cleaner  \\n2 - Undrinkable, last resort where one sip is enough  \\n3 - Vulgar, painful to finish a pour and the bottle will probably gather dust  \\n4 - Indecent, would be average but something doesn't sit right   \\n5 - Average, run of the mill that goes well with a chaser  \\n6 - Decent, usually added into cocktails or on ice  \\n7 - Good, can drink straight without complaining   \\n8 - Great, something reserved for close family or friends  \\n9 - Excellent, something reserved for those special moments in life  \\n10 - Perfection, the precious to my Gollum\",\n",
       " \"####**Review #130: Barton 1792 Small Batch**\\n*No Age Statement; 46.85% ABV; $30*\\n\\n**Nose:** Very standard bourbon nose - typical caramel and vanilla sweets, moderate about of woody oak with just a little tannic complexity. It doesn't smell as young as I expected and the heat is well tamed.\\n\\n**Taste:** Yep, tastes like bourbon. No surprises here as it's mostly a rehash of the nose. On the sweet side I find a little extra honey in the mix now and the finish has a little rye spice tingle. Again my biggest surprise is it doesn't taste as young as I expected. Unlike the Bottle in Bond product which must be the product of distillate from the same season, I suspect this small batch is a mix of some older and younger barrels which I think has created a nice balance of younger grain forward fruity notes along with older more tannic complex wood notes.\\n\\n**Thoughts:** This is about as standard of a bourbon as you can get. It's not too woody, not too young, not too sweet, and not very bitter. It's just an all around safe bourbon whiskey. That might be its biggest downfall though as that also makes it somewhat boring. If you are just looking for a good daily sipper this would fit that bill very nicely and I feel it's just a notch above some of the other products near this price range like Wild Turkey 101 and Old Forester Signature though not as good as something like Henry McKenna or Eagle Rare. \\n\\n**Rating: B-**\\n\\n**Value:** As always, I don’t factor cost into my ratings. Considering that I've paid almost double this price for whiskeys I've rated about the same, I think this a decent buy. \",\n",

       " '**Background:**  I’ve been a bourbon fan for years.  Lately my hobby of drinking bourbon has intrigued my wife, and has led her to want to join me on my bourbon journey.  She knows I lurk this sub, and she’s usually with me when I watch bourbon reviews/blinds on YouTube.   In the past several months, as I’ve picked up a bottle here or there, she’s wanted to sample my purchases, which of course I’ve happily obliged every time. Recently we’ve been watching advent blinds on Youtube, and she loved the idea of participating in blinds.  Well tonight was the night to try.  Easy day, 4” of snow on the ground, nothing going on, let’s do this!\\n\\n**Bourbons:**  To start off, I decided that we should do “budget bourbons” or daily drinkers.  Each of the bottles picked for tonight’s blinds cost around $25-30 locally (in MO).  We have:\\n1.  1792 Small Batch\\n2. Buffalo Trace (my open bottle happens to be a store pick)\\n3. Elijah Craig Small Batch.  \\n\\nWe each blindly poured each other’s samples, and away we went.  Note that during the blind I poured the samples from small whiskey glasses into glen glasses, to keep some consistency.  More glens are on order!\\n\\nNow normally in a post like this it’d make sense to go through each glass ( A, B, C) and highlight the notes that each of us had…but it just so happens that my wife and I completely unknowingly poured the same whiskey in the same order…so that should make this post easy!\\n\\n**Our thoughts were as follows:**\\n\\nA:  Nose:  Sweetness, a bit of oak.  Wife caught some faint florals.  Mouth & Palate: Thin, oak, not too spicy, a bit of must.\\n  \\nB:  Nose Very sweet.  Bananas – I caught some banana nut bread, along with fruit.  Mouth was also thin, fruity with very little spice.  \\n\\nC: Oak, slight hints of dried fruit, with a bit of sweetness. Mouth was thin, with oak and a bit of a stronger finish than the others.  \\n\\n**Ranks:**  B, C, A\\n\\n**Bottles:**  A: ECSB, B: 1792, C: BT\\n\\n**Overall Thoughts:**  Not surprised that we both really liked the 1792;  its been a go-to for me for quite some time.  At $26 locally, it’s hard to pass up. I love most BT products, but I definitely find myself filling my glass with 1792 more often.  But my lasting conclusion was that this was a blast to do with my wife.  We have our bourbon notebooks, I get to utilize one of my other hobbies (Fountain Pens)…even the kids got a huge kick out of us trying to put our notes down, sniffing glasses, and tasting bourbon.  Maybe in 11 years I’ll get my son in on the tasting too!',\n",
       " 'So I was doing some grocery shopping and decided to take a glance at the liquor section\\'s \"clearance\" rack and spotted this bottle. Noticed that they had marked it down because it had the rear label incorrectly slapped on the front, therefore covering up the 1792 that\\'s screen printed on the front. I couldn\\'t pass it up since it was a bottle I had yet to try and the price was right.\\n\\n---\\n**1792 Small Batch** / 46.85% ABV\\n\\nNeat in a glencairn\\n\\n**Region/Type:** Bourbon\\n\\n**Chill-Filtration:** YES\\n\\n**Nose** - Muted vanilla, milk chocolate covered caramel, wet oak, brown sugar simple, baking soda.\\n\\n**Taste** - Very thin but \"smooth\" mouthfeel, lightly bitter oak, almost chalky caramel sweetness, like if you took a vanilla caramel, but made it into the old candy cigarette texture.\\n\\n**Finish** - Lingering lightly bitter oak, kind of like if you took a brown sugar simple syrup and used a micro barrel to age it, but forot about it for a while so that it\\'s an overoaked sweet syrupy mess.\\n\\n**71/100**\\n\\nPurchased: June of 2015 / 750mL / ~$27 USD (after WA state taxes of 20.5% + $3.77/liter)\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo I guess I shouldn\\'t have too high expectations for this one given the price. This wasn\\'t a bad bourbon by any means, but it wasn\\'t great either. It had a very \"standard\" bourbon profile in that it didn\\'t really have any very off-putting nose or taste, but it was just kind of boring. The weird oaky sweetness and very subtle vanilla and caramel notes was a bit off-putting. Maybe it just doesn\\'t fit my palate or maybe I\\'m having an off day, but I\\'m glad I got to try this bottle at a discount, because I\\'m not sure this is a bottle I\\'d really reach for again.',\n",
       " \"Ummm, so if I'm reading this right, the yellow necked bottle on the left is the second commented on (100pf) that you enjoyed it so much you went thru it before realizing it.  FYI, did you also not realize that it was actually a store pick of 1792BIB (Bottled in Bond) and not Small Batch (maroon neck)?  That's why you went thru it so quick, it's a really good 1792 variety (the best IMHO although I've yet to find a bottle of 12yr).\",\n",
       " \"**Review #5: 1792 Sweet Wheat**\\n\\nThis is from a sample I got from a friend. 1792 Sweet Wheat is the latest release from the Barton 1792 Distillery, and as far as I know the first time they have produced a wheated bourbon. I'm not sure if this is a one-time release or something that's going to be part of their lineup going forward, but everybody seems to be going nuts trying to get some of this for some reason.\\n\\n**Specs:** Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, no age statement, 91.2 proof (45.6% abv)\\n\\n**Tasting Notes**\\n\\nTasted in a Glencairn, neat.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Medium amber. Nice thick legs on the glass.\\n\\n**Nose:** Brown sugar, pecan, hint of cinnamon, ethanol, maybe some banana in the background. Definitely can pick up the Barton family resemblance on the nose.\\n\\n**Taste:** Vanilla pudding, more of that brown sugar, pecan, and caramel. Some spicy oak. Thankfully no banana. Nice oily mouthfeel.\\n\\n**Finish:** Nice long cinnamon turns bitter, not really in a way I like.\\n\\n**Overall:** It's good to see a new recipe on the market (if it actually *stays* on the market), and aside from the finish this is a pretty nice bourbon. Very different from the other wheaters on the market. I think it's been going for around $39 retail, which I think is a bit high for what this is. **B-/C+**\\n\\nThis is a nice change of pace, but I don't think it's one that I'll be hunting for a bottle of if it's as highly allocated as I've heard.\",\n",
       " 'Another mystery sample courtesy of u/ScotchChick, I\\'ll just jump right in.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n**Color:** yep, it\\'s Whiskey!\\n\\n**Nose:** Lightly sweet and smooth(very smooth) caramel, it\\'s a Bourbon but also has some mildly spicy Rye notes. The oak is definitely there, but it\\'s \"quiet\" and non-intrusive. Light and floral, overall very delicate nose for a Bourbon\\n\\n**Taste:** Dry, yet sweet and malty. Quite sweet. Tangy, sweet oak with a little chocolate. Overall kind of thin and flat, but good.\\n\\n**Finish:** Unsurprisingly, a very sweet finish. Friendly sugary caramel oak, tapers off into chocolatiness that is slightly richer(not much richer though).\\n\\n*****\\n\\nFriendly and sweet, but a little thin and lacking is what I get here. Not amazing, but not bad at all and quite drinkable. This is a Whiskey that someone who doesn\\'t drink Whiskey could still enjoy. I\\'m guessing this is right around 45%, definitely not any higher than 50%. It reminded me of FRSB a little bit, but it\\'s not a high enough proof. My (shot in the dark, uneducated) guess is Elmer T Lee. I\\'ve only had it once a while ago, but I remember it being thin and friendly.

Whereas that one instantly screamed WHEATER to me, this one actually took me a second to decide it was even a Bourbon and not a Scotch. I did pick up a sweet maltiness in the taste, which might be what I pick up from WHEATERS since I got that in Weller 12 as well.

Sour cherries, vanilla, prominent oak, and salted caramel. A touch of nuttiness. I'm surprised at how much wood I'm getting from the nose alone. \\n\\n**Palate:** Peanut butter up front, with dark chocolate and then a big ole bunch of wood. It has quite a comfortable mouthfeel without a whole lot of heat, so I'd guess this is proofed down some, but not overly so. \\n\\n**Finish:** More oak, long, tannic, and dry. Bitter cocoa. \\n\\n**Summary:** This guy is an oak bomb. I'm thinking it's one of the older Elijah Craig offerings.

Lemon custard, fresh pastry, and key lime pie. The citrus is strong with this one. It has a bit of a sour edge. Cinnamon and nutmeg spices are awoken from a little air. \\n\\n**Palate:** Sour again, but almost like sourdough bread. Very thin, without a whole lot going on. Some mild caramel kinda flavor, and light on the palate. I'd guess this is 45% ABV, max. It seems to suffer a little for it. Some woody notes, but they aren't particularly prominent either. \\n\\n**Finish:** It doesn't bail too quickly, but there isn't a sudden explosion of new flavors either. More of the palate notes. \\n\\n**Summary:** I'm not getting a whole lot out of this pour. It's palatable and inoffensive, but not all that interesting to me. It reminds me of Evan Williams Single Barrel, which I was similarly unimpressed with, so I'll guess that it is one of those.\\n\\n**Score: 81/100** \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Mystery Sample #3**\\n\\n**Strength:** ??.?%\\n\\n**Color:** Golden brown. \\n\\n**Nose:** This is the softest nose right off the bat. Sweet and mild caramel, milk chocolate, with some almond butter rounding it out. It's got an odd Lipton sweet tea note to it as well. \\n\\n**Palate:** It's a bit more assertive of a dram. Caramel-forward, it has some nice toffee and wood flavors. It also seems a bit low on the proof, I'd guess sub 50%. \\n\\n**Finish:** The wood notes take over and deliver a light tobacco finish that lingers from mid-palate to oak. \\n\\n**Summary:** A nice dram that is refined, and not at all brash. I want a little more out of it.

       " \"The bourbon circles were really surprised several months ago when news of an 8 year old wheated Bourbon from Barton emerged. Like most of the current whiskey crowd, I'm a fan of wheaters so I was really looking forward to something different and a little older than the other wheated products that regularly stock the shelves. Unfortunately what I thought would be an easy to find bottle ended up being the total opposite in my local market. Of my two preferred locals, one got shut out completely and the other store got a single bottle which I am reviewing here today. \\n***\\n**Review #113: 1792 Sweet Wheat**\\n\\n*No Age Statement (website claims 8 years); 45.6% ABV; $35; Distilled by Barton*\\n\\nI'm not one to usually care about packaging but I'd like to give a nod to Barton on their current label and bottle design. I really dig the retro modern look of this product. \\n\\n**Nose:** Woody, dark fruits, a little spice zip, and some tannic bitter tea. Smells about right for 8 years. Alcohol is well tamed, smells spot on for the proof. \\n\\n**Taste:** Nice but simple balance of sweet to oak. Finish tapers off with some darker tannic notes and less sweetness. Not complex beyond that at all but it really doesn't need to be. Again like the nose I think it tastes its age or a little older as the oak notes have some complexity to them. I'm only getting a little bit of the standard wheater vibe from this one - there is minimal cinnamon that I am used to in the Buffalo Trace of Maker's Mark library of wheated products. Honestly if I had this blind I would have a hard time guessing it's a wheated bourbon which really makes me wonder about the mashbill here.\\n\\n**Thoughts:** Good but nothing super memorable. In my hierarchy of wheated bourbons I would rank this above standard Maker's Mark, around the same as standard Old Weller Antique, but below Maker's Mark Cask Strength. The profile is completely different than all those other products which is helping it in the uniqueness category. I really hope availability increases as it is something I could go back to if it were easy to find.\\n\\n**Rating:** B-\\n\\nYou can find more of my reviews on my blog [signde drinks](http://signdedrinks.blogspot.com/2015/08/review-113-1792-sweet-wheat.html).\",\n",

A lot of vanilla, but not the type of vanilla I usually get in bourbon. Pretty unhelpful note, I know.

A tad one dimensional with the orange peel note sticking out the most, but all in all this is a nice nose! **8/10**\\n\\n**Taste** Vanilla pudding, charred oak, pepper, dried fruits, brown sugar, toasted wheat bread. The youth is rearing it\\'s ugly head as the notes are pretty rough around the edges, but these flavors play well together. **40/50**\\n\\n**Body** Medium-thin and leaves behind lots of oil. I would like it to be more full to compliment the rich sweet flavors. **7/10**\\n\\n**Finish** The finish starts very hot, fireworks on the tongue almost! And then quickly fades to a subdued level where a raisin and vanilla pudding note hang around. **15/20**\\n\\n**Value** As I\\'m doing some searching it looks like the MSRP is about $32 which puts this guy right in line with Maker\\'s in my area. I would reach for this bottle over the more \"name brand\" Maker\\'s any day! However, the Weller line is still less expensive (when available...for now) which does knock this down a little bit. **8/10**\\n***\\n**Overall** I was very excited to hear about a new wheater entering the market. Despite my rather lukewarm ratings, I would say this is a solid product worth the pick up! I would take this over Maker\\'s most days, but I would still keep some Maker\\'s around for those only looking for \"smooth\" in their drink as this can be a little rough around the edges. If you see it, snag one! **Total: 78/100**\\n\\nBourbon review **79**\\n\\nNetwork review **120**',\n",
       " \"*Review #81*\\n\\n**1792 Sweet Wheat (91.2 proof)**\\n\\nNose: clove, confectionery and grape sugar, fruit snacks, toasted coconut and coconut oil, rum raisin, strawberry shortcake, vanilla custard and nougat, toasted almond cookie, polished leather\\n\\nTaste: dired fruits, sour candy and sweet caramel followed by a creamy oak and nutty mid palate and then a charred, astringent back end; juicy mouthfeel\\n\\nFinish: short to medium length of bitter cherry, oak, vanilla extract, and coffee rinds then a nice fruit candy end that lingers indefinitely \\n\\nOverall: I am liking this. It has the qualities I love from a standard wheater: the candied fruits and creamy backbone. There also is a nice rum like raisin/coconut quality going on that makes the 1792 distinct from other wheaters. The palate is sweet and juicy despite having quite an astringent back end. It is a charred, bitter quality that lingers a bit too long into the finish but once that lets up, you are left with a heavenly fruit candy note that lasts forever, beckoning for another sip. I want this at 100 proof for what I paid, but the age is just right. If it is more available than Weller, I'd pick this up more. Weller is still king in terms of range, taste and value but this is good wheat juice.\\n\\nRating: Excellent (87/100)\\n\\nBTW, I really like the redesign for the 1792 bottle. It has this simple, refined art deco thing going on. \",\n",
       " \"**American Whiskey Review #26: 1792 Sweet Wheat**\\n\\n**Distillery:** Barton 1792\\n\\n**Region:** Kentucky\\n\\n**Price:** Thanks to /u/pwnedapanda for letting me try this!\\n\\n**ABV:** 45.6%\\n\\n**Age:** NAS.\\n\\n**Color:** [1.3, Russet/Muscat](https://i.imgur.com/CIl8iNs.jpg). \\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Nose:** It smells of a freshly baked sweet bread loaded up with vanilla and a bit of spice.\\n\\n**Palate:** Rather silky mouthfeel. There's a bit of fruit up front in the form of a dark cherry. That gives way a bit to a sweet bread note, its slightly sweeter than a brioche or challah but not quite as sweet as a Hawaiian bread though it gets sweeter as you go on. A bit of cola comes in behind this bringing the dark cherry back with it as well along with a bit of oak spice.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-to-short in length. More that sweet bread note lingers along with some oak spice.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** If you've ever wanted to try liquefied, alcoholic bread, this whiskey is that. It's fairly straight forward, the only notes that pop up are a sweet bread and a bit of dark cherry cola, but it's pretty delicious. The sweetness intensifies as you drink which makes it far too easy to keep drinking. Much like the [1792 Single Barrel](https://scotchandsheen.com/2019/10/31/1792-single-barrel-select-hyvee/) I'd had, I imagine this is a dram I'd keep going back to. Would I buy a bottle?

       " 'As the title mentions, this is my first /r/bourbon review, so be nice!  I do review lots of beers on BeerAdvocate.com, though. Bought this bottle ~6 months ago at a Specs (big TX liquor chain). Went in not really knowing much about bourbon (except that I loved a good bourbon barrel-aged beer), and the Specs worker kind of pushed this one on me, claiming for the price point it was better than Maker’s Mark and that I should give it a try. Well, why the hell not? It does say *”come and take it!”* after all.\\n\\n**Texas 1835 Bourbon Whiskey** 90 Proof, ~$22 for a 750ml bottle. Drank neat.\\n\\n*Appearance:*\\n\\nStreaky, globular legs are quick to form. Not very organized. Body is a very light golden-amber hue, with a white-wine clarity at the edges.\\n\\n*Aroma:*\\n\\n Light tropical fruit phenols of pineapple, pear, and mango up front. Digging deeper fills the nose with grainy spice, charcoal and hot ethanol. Pretty simple aroma, really. Not a whole lot of depth, but nothing really there to offend the nose, either.\\n\\n*Flavor:* \\n\\nA bit of cinnamon-like spice on the front of the tongue with a subtle sweetness of caramel and vanilla. Tannic finish with a sour, grainy aftertaste. Quite harsh for the proof, and medicinal qualities abound. Much better mixed with some Ginger Ale than neat or cut. \\n\\n*Mouthfeel:* \\n\\nThin on the palate, but creamy at first. Opens up to a slow burn on the finish. Alcohol lingers long after each sip.\\n\\n*Overall:*\\n\\n **67/100** A fairly poor example of bourbon. I’m not exactly sure what the story is behind this whiskey. States that it was bottled by 1835 in Lewisville, Texas, but my money is on it being distilled/aged somewhere else. Can’t say I’d recommend this one, but it does mix decently, for what it’s worth…\\n',\n",

       " 'I’m a bit late on this one, so let’s go a bit quick.\\n\\n66 Gillead was a distillery in Prince Edward County. They made rum, gin, eau du vie, whisky, and probably other things I’m forgetting. They were sold and the name was changed to Kinsip, with some changes and some whiskies staying similar.\\n\\n**66 Gilead Wild Oak**, specifically batch 003, is a bourbon-style whisky, and non-chill filtered and no colour added. I believe it’s roughly 4-5 years old, though again I’m remembering that from a distant time I was there, and not so much from a straight source, so let’s just go with NAS.\\n\\nMashbill includes corn, wheat, rye, and malted barley, and I believe someone told me a bit of the barley was peated for this batch, though again that’s hearsay.\\n\\nSo let’s just get to the point: Does it taste good? The name may have changed, but what did it use to taste like? Let’s see, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** No longer available.\\n\\n**Region:** Canada\\n\\n**Abv:** 47%\\n\\n**Colour:** 7.5YR 6/10\\n\\n**Nose:** Lemon, oaky, cardboard, honeydew melon\\n\\nOn the good side, this has some fruit and acidity to it. The oak has leant to it. I’m getting a different nose than normal bourbon style whiskies.\\n\\nThat said, there are some young cardboard notes on it that sometimes crop up on craft whiskies.\\n\\n**Taste:** Lemon, oak, earth, caramel, chemical\\n\\nGood side: More of that lemon, some earth, some caramel.\\n\\nUnfortunate? Time gives us this chemical aspect that I’m not loving. Again, youth isn’t helping here.\\n\\n**Finish:** Mushroom, smoke, dry apple, caramel\\n\\nEarthy. The finish doesn’t have that rough aspect. But that smoke is helping finish things up. Changes the profile just a bit. Good addition there.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Good start, but needs more time. The downside of doing a bourbon style in Canada is you don’t get the benefit of that hyper-ageing, and I think this shows it. That said, I don’t know the type of cask used, so perhaps a virgin cask needs to be used. Or maybe it doesn’t.\\n\\nWhat I will say is this is certainly unique. Given some more time, maybe some more tweaking, this is different. And that’s something to champion.\\n\\nSo grab a sample of this, and then grab a sample of the new one. See what you think about it. I think there’s a bunch of lemons and something that bridges the gap between single malts and Canadian whiskies.\\n\\n**64/100**\\n\\n*World Whiskey review #335, Canada review #113, Whisky Network review #1590*\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\\n\\n',\n",

Finish my accounting schooling, find a new job in a new career space, making running jokes that only I’ll appreciate at all, and review enough Irish Whiskey to finally hit 100 total reviews.\\n\\nI’m happy to say I got most of that done, and regularly laugh to myself like a crazy person. As for posting the reviews, I may have gotten behind what with learning derivatives and verbally masturbating. So I’m posting them now! Yay!\\n\\nThis is the last one, folks. We’re at **A Drop of the Irish Black Adder 2016 Sherry Cask Finish Single Cask**. One that was specifically handed to me to be the last Irish of 2018. Heck, it was my last dram of 2018. \\n\\nSo what is it? Well, it’s a no age statement, no colouring, no filtering offering that’s released once a year from Blackadder, an independent bottler. They also state it’s unpeated, and from one of the oldest distilleries. They also state it’s in County Antrim.\\n\\nAt this point, you may have Googled what distillery is there. If you haven’t, shame on you, learn to do some research and be informed. It’s Bushmills you lazy person.\\n\\nSo there’re different versions of A Drop of Irish. Some single casks, some vatted, and some with age statements that are making me jealous of people able to afford it, and then kinda hating myself for putting myself down. I’m doing okay.\\n\\nThis particular one was bottled in 2016, is sherry cask finished, and is a single cask. All the things I enjoy. So let’s see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** Currently not available at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** Ireland\\n\\n**Bottled:** April 2016\\n\\n**Cask Type:** Sherry Cask Finish\\n\\n**Number of bottles:** 349\\n\\n**Abv:** 58.9%\\n\\n**Colour:** 7.5Y 8/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Nail polish, hot peanut oil, canned pears, honey\\n\\nImmediate alcohol. Gave it more time to open up. Some nuttiness, some of that heat is still there. More time gives me pears and honey. Water brings out more sweetness and calms it down, but wow is this hot.\\n\\n**Taste:** Canned pear, vanilla, hot, caramel cake, peanut, orange\\n\\nMore sweet, more of that pear, though now it’s more…. Wow, just got hot. Alright, more time with this one.\\n\\nOnce I’ve added water and showed some patience like Gail King in an interview with a paedophile, there’s a nice caramel cake note. Lovely nuttiness, some orange to balance it out. But wow is it hot and sweet.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cinnamon, hot, peanut butter, basil, orange rind, Twizzlers\\n\\nMore heat, and now it goes really bitter. Before the bitter aspect was calm or balanced with the bakeshop of sweets it had. Now? Water helps, but this is bitter. Really bitter. Bitter like me wanting to have an age statement version of this.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Too hot and bitter. I can see what they liked about this one. I can also see a bunch of reasons why this needed time in the cask. Much more time. Wow is this hot. Sure, it’s sweet as hell and there’s a lovely nutty/cake note in there as well. The sherry is trying it’s hardest to balance out strong vanilla.\\n\\nIt’s just… really strong. That brought it down a lot.

The structure is a bit overpowering, requiring a lot of water to come to heel and show off its fruit as well. That\\'s not necessarily a knock, almost no barrel proofers are destined for totally neat greatness, nor do they need to be, but if it takes that much water to dial it back, serve it up at 50% and don\\'t make a man sweat that he\\'s murdering the good that is there in the hope that it comes around to something better. I\\'ve got to dock it a bit for balance even though eventually I found it. Most people wouldn\\'t, and that\\'s a shame. \\n\\n- 90 points  \\n\\n100-90: This is stellar stuff. Its got to have some \"magic\" beyond being a complete dram to get an A out of me.

You\\'re at least giving me a competent dram that I\\'d be willing to buy, all the way up to a complete, or flawed beauty of a dram that just doesn\\'t have the \"magic\" to be special. \\n\\n70-79: This is ok stuff. You\\'re doing C level work here. I hope it isn\\'t any kind of expensive, and I probably won\\'t drink it neat. There are times for this level whiskey in your life, even ones where it fits the bill well, but its notably flawed stuff that, at best, has one or two things working for it well. \\n\\n0-69: This isn\\'t passable stuff. Even mixed, I\\'m going to pass. You should too. There\\'s too much good whiskey out there today at reasonable prices for you to bother with this. If you can\\'t afford the $10-12 to drink something better, you shouldn\\'t be drinking, you\\'ve got bigger issues.\\n',\n",
       " \"I will start by disclaiming that the connection between these two whiskeys is admittedly a bit tenuous. A Smith Bowman is owned by Sazerac, as of course is Buffalo Trace, but the similarities start to diverge pretty quickly. Buffalo Trace ships their distilled white dog (mashbills #1 & #2) to Virginia where it is re-distilled, blended, and aged by Bowman in VA. From what I have heard from friends who have visited A Smith Bowman, they go to decent lengths to proclaim it as a significantly different product. \\n&nbsp;\\n\\nLast year marked the first release of A Smith Bowman’s Cask Strength offering. As if a new double-digit age stated, cask strength release from a popular distillery was not enough to whip up a frenzy, it also clocked in at a hazmat proof (141.1). Since I am:  \\nA) Impressionable  \\n\\nB) Spending a lot of time at home trying not to get covid  \\n\\nC) Blessed with very generous friends who pour me things and let me take pictures of their bottles  \\n\\nI chose to take my good friend’s proclamation (and honestly a good few others) that Bowman Cask Strength is on par with the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and put it to the test. \\n&nbsp;\\n\\n###A Smith Bowman Cask Strength (10 years, 141.1 Proof)\\n**Nose:** VANILLA, lots of it. There’s some oak and caramel here as well. It’s a standard bourbon profile with the volume turned up, especially on the vanilla.  \\n\\n**Palate:** Right off the bat creme brulee, cherry cordials, brown sugar. Specifically in comparison to GTS, I found it to be sweeter as opposed to syrupy. The difference between a cinnamon sugar donut and a healthy dose of maple syrup for example.\\n\\n**Finish:** Long and heavy on the spices, cinnamon and nutmeg in particular.\\n \\n**9/10 (t8ke scale)**  \\n  \\n**Overall:** Since release, the reputation of this whiskey has largely preceded it. You'll find no contrarian take here, this is an incredible pour. \\n&nbsp;\\n\\n###2020 George T. Stagg (15 years, 130.4 Proof)\\n**Nose:** Overripe cherries, burnt wood and caramel. It’s a more balanced nose than the Bowman in that those notes are fairly evenly potent as opposed to an overwhelming rush of vanilla. \\n    \\n**Palate:** Dark chocolate, molasses, cherry syrup, oak, and vanilla all swirl together. In direct comparison with the Bowman it’s thicker feeling and that extra time in the barrel provides a richer wood note.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Tobacco, leather, and a lovely bitter dark chocolate. \\n\\n**10/10 (t8ke scale)**  \\n\\n**Overall:** This is, to me, a perfect whiskey. And honestly, it’s a bit hard for me to write anything else from there without it turning into a word vomit of justifications for giving something a perfect score. It just is exactly what I want in a pour, sweet but not too sweet, oak but not over-cooked, rich dark fruit notes that make you feel like you’re drinking something exotic. \\n\\nAfter first tasting and rating the Bowman Cask Strength, I wanted to see if side by side it truly held up against George T Stagg. The answer for me is a resounding yes, both of these are incredible whiskeys, and I count myself as extremely fortunate to be able to try them. \\n&nbsp;\\n\\nLast but not least, to help contextualize here are some ranks I have of other things for comparison!  \\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**1 | Disgusting:** Sagamore Spirit Tequila Finish \\n  \\n**2 | Poor:** Black Maple Hill Oregon Straight Bourbon Whiskey\\n\\n**3 | Bad:** Blue Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel\\n\\n**4 | Sub-par:** Blade and Bow Straight Bourbon \\n\\n**5 | Good:** Old Forester 1910   \\n\\n**6 | Very Good:** Smoke Wagon Uncut Unfiltered (Batch 56)   \\n\\n**7 | Great:** Cream of Kentucky 13 Year \\n\\n**8 | Excellent:** Russell's Reserve 13 Year\\n\\n**9 | Incredible:** A Smith Bowman Cask Strength (Batch 1)  \\n\\n**10 | Perfect:** George T Stagg 2020\",\n",
       " 'I don’t normally add a preamble unless I have something to add above and beyond what one can google, and in this case I need to disclose just how much I dislike AD Laws. Not necessarily the product (I’ll get to that later), but what the brand became around here, at least for a while. After the distillery started releasing product, every single freaking store was hyping the product, and using the master distiller’s pedigree (Stranahan’s) as justification. Well, I was lucky enough to try a sample before being suckered into buying a bottle, and easily wrote off buying a bottle. Same thing when they released their rye – luckily /u/dustlesswalnut had some already and I could confirm what I feared – it was bottled too young, and the profile doesn’t suit me. Unfortunately my best friend got talked into buying a bottle for me as a Christmas present, and I felt like total shit when he could easily see through my trying to fake excitement at the bottle when I received the present.

There’s complexity here, but all of the flavors are ones I don’t enjoy.

       " 'Review #7 – A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon – a brand new offering from Laws Whiskey House in Denver. Master distiller Jake Norris, formerly of Stranahan’s is the one who made this bourbon. It’s 47.5% abv, and a single barrel selection from Lukas Liquors. Tasted neat in a rocking glass.\\n\\nMashbill – 60 corn/20 wheat/10 rye/10 barley. All but the corn are locally grown, and every grain is a mix between malted and raw grains.\\n\\nColor – Very red. Not incredibly dark, but it makes me think a little of mahogany.\\n\\nNose – Leather and tobacco – tons of it. On my first glass last night, it was totally overpowering. No alcohol smell, really. Very rich. Oaky scents come through after a bit of rest, and some baked goods smell. The wheat is pretty evident with the lack of big spices and sweets. It smells very Scotch-y to me.\\n\\nTaste – Pretty thick feeling in the mouth. Leather and oak still prevail, but I’m finally getting some bourbon sweetness in it. Vanilla is there, and caramel.\\n\\nFinish – Long and smooth. It starts with char and leather, it then fades to sweet caramel and vanilla before bringing tobacco back into the picture. Very complex and quite enjoyable.\\n\\nSmell in the glass the next morning – Leather is still present, but a cedar-like smell dominates. Quite curious\\n\\nThis is much better today than the first glass was last night. That glass was nothing but leather and smoke it seemed, and I was afraid I’d thrown money away. The complexity really reminds me of Scotch.\\n\\nSide by sides:\\n\\nGlenmorangie 10: The only scotch I have in my collection, I’m interested to compare the smoky and leathery notes between the two. **Noses**: Leather and tobacco in both, for sure. The leather is much stronger in the Laws. Laws really just has a much more potent nose altogether. **Tastes**: The Scotch has more fruit in it, along with peat (obviously). The smoke and leather are still stronger in the Laws, but there’s a similarity between the two. **Finishes**: This reminds me of why I’m not a fan of (this) Scotch. The finish is just foul. It’s smoky, like the Laws, but the peat and something else just don’t jive with me.\\n\\nLarceny: The only other wheater I like right now. Let’s look at how much more complex the four grain is. **Noses**: Larceny almost doesn’t have a nose compared to Laws. It has more vanilla, and more young oak. **Tastes**: Larceny, while good, is just a lot more boring. I like it still, but it’s just lacking. There’s no tobacco or char present, and the baked goods in the Larceny is still in the Laws. Larceny is also much thinner in the mouth. **Finishes**: Similar once the leather fades from the Laws.\\n\\nFour Roses small batch: Just a solid, standard bourbon. I’m interested to see if I find the Laws more similar to this or to the Scotch. **Noses**: There’s a shared char that’s stronger in the Laws. FR gives more of the traditional caramel and vanilla. FR is about as rich as Laws, but much more subdued.  **Tastes**: More sweet notes in the FR, but overall very similar at the core. **Finishes**: These two finishes are the most similar. The FR has the leather/tobacco that’s present in the Laws, and in a more subtle manner.\\n\\nLaws is a fantastic true craft bourbon, and I’m a huge fan. It’s slightly Scotch-y, but still a bourbon underneath it all. Is it a daily drinker? Maybe. Is it something I could have multiple glasses of in a sitting? No way. It’s so rich and flavorful that my senses would quickly get overwhelmed. I could see this being a great pairing with a rich steak meal and a latakia-heavy pipe tobacco.\\n\\nFinal score: 93/100\\n',\n",

They are also doing barrel releases and cask strength offerings along with their general distribution of the bourbon and rye bottles.  Future plans include a wheat whiskey as well.  I really like what AD Laws is doing in that everything is under their control.  Locally grown grains are used (except for the corn), it's distilled on site in Denver, and then placed in 53 gallon charred barrels and aged in the AD Laws warehouse.  The master distiller comes from the Stranahan's brand, and partnered with Mr. Laws himself to create this new brand and begin producing another flavor of Colorado whiskey.  I read about this limited edition, Bottled in Bond release being available in the local market a couple weeks ago, and I ran down to their Denver distillery to pick up a bottle.  Being a bourbon fan, and a fan of Colorado beers and spirits, this is a bottle I couldn't pass up given the extra effort to produce a BiB bourbon here in this state.\\n\\nThe price is steep at $90, even four a startup craft bourbon.  It's way more than I (usually) feel comfortable spending, but along with the tasting opportunity I do feel like supporting the local whiskey community is a good thing, especially in the case of the Laws operation.  The short square bottle is nice and unique, and the black and silver labeling for the BiB release shows very well.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Color:**  Copper\\n\\n**Nose:**  Lots of alcohol initially.  Astringent.  I smelled grains, leather, tobacco and other dry elements.  Some hints of cake batter and vanilla.  Letting the bottle breathe for a few days helped with the alcohol.\\n\\n**Taste:**:  Similar to the nose.  Surprising lack of sweetness given the mash bill and age.  Very dry and malty; almost scotch like.  More leather.  Mouth feel had a decent syrupy texture - not thick, but not too thin either.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Finish was short to medium and a bit bitter, with more leather or wet tobacco.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI really wanted to love this pour, and have something local in Colorado to get excited about.  But for me, I love the sweetness and complexity of an aged Kentucky bourbon, and I didn't get either of those characteristics (yet) from the Laws Four Grain Bottled in Bond bourbon.  If you generally like scotch and other dry malt whiskies, then this pour may appeal to you more.  But I want a sweeter, more traditional bourbon profile, and I just don't get enough of it with the Laws Bottled in Bond offering to thoroughly enjoy it.  I'm sure 2-4 more years in the barrel will do it some good, but I guess we will have to wait and see.\\n\\nOverall:  **77/100**\",\n",

Deeply toasted oak, maple, fudge, amazingly rich and clean wood notes, huge fruitiness of orange and black cherry, clean vanilla and menthol. Beautiful oaky char at the tail end. Huge and rich but so smooth and balanced at the same time, it hits every single \"smooth oaky Bourbon\" note in the book and hits them well.\\n\\n**Taste:** Very nice but it\\'s subtle and complex, a little light and it doesn\\'t just immediately floor me like the nose did. Surprisingly fruity and sweet with lots of clean, pleasant toasted wood. It\\'s not overly oaked or tannic at all, it\\'s a delicious kind of sweet toasted maple woodiness. Flows together beautifully with clean vanilla, cherry and orange zest, light smooth chocolate, pleasant caramel. Once I acclimate to the lower proof it has this silky smooth mouthfeel but without being short on rich flavor. Not every Bourbon has to be a high proof smack to the face, and this stuff illustrates that perfectly.\\n\\n**Finish:** Sweet and smoothly oaky. Sweet caramel and vanilla with clean, utterly delicious chocolatey toasted wood. Not a long enough finish, but very tasty and enjoyable.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nThis was a delicious pour. Amazingly balanced and smooth but not short on rich and delicious flavor. For better or worse I\\'m a total proof whore, and the low ABV here definitely took a few sips to adjust to. But once I did I was thoroughly rewarded. It\\'s nice to just sit and enjoy something with such a silky smooth mouthfeel that still has so much amazing flavor and doesn\\'t feel thin or watered down. That being said, while it does well for 46% it is still noticeably light at such a low ABV. Especially on the finish, which is tasty but a little weak.

This is my first time trying this, and it's been on my radar for some time. It's bottled at 45.8% ABV.\\n\\n**Nose** Fantastic nose - very similar to an OBSO four roses single barrel. If I was nosing it blind and you told me that's what it was - I wouldn't be surprised in the least. Vanilla, charred oak, very floral, honey, caramel, some mint, brown sugar, and fresh baked cookies. A very dynamic nose that introduces something new each time you go back to it.\\n\\n**Mouthfeel** Very light weight and watery in texture\\n\\n**Palate** Not nearly as complex/rich as the nose - oak is dominant all around, but it remains fairly sweet - some butterscotch and a bit of a yeasty zing follow up.\\n\\n**Finish** Delicate balance of sweet/spice with a lot of cinnamon & cloves matching the strength of the brown sugar. Very floral on the tip of the tongue.\\n\\n**Balance** No complaints here - everything comes together in a perfect harmony\\n\\n**Rating 95/100** - Great bourbon - it definitely lived up to the hype. The nose is amazing - the most complex nose I've had in awhile. That doesn't mean that I'm going to go out and sell my left arm for a bottle, but I'd definitely recommend trying this if you see it at a bar for a reasonable price. It's one of those classic bourbons that I feel like everyone who's serious about whiskey has to try at some point.\\n\\n**Value for the money** This is more up to your budget - most people I assume would be trying this at a bar which I imagine will run you $30 at a minimum, but likely higher than that. If you're cash strapped, I really do feel like the OBSO single barrel recipe from Four Roses comes pretty close to what this offers.\",\n",

The biggest difference between these two was in the nose; the distillery bottling was very spicy and interesting while the Signatory was very plain and almost vodka-like, with a weird chemical note. As far as taste goes, the distillery bottling was sweeter and easier drinking, while the Signatory was drier and hotter with more oakiness.\\n\\nI was really pleasantly surprised with the Aberfeldy 12, especially as I'm not a huge fan of the Dewars blended scotches, of which this is a core component.

My first thoughts are of sweetness, lots of butterscotch but not to the point of it being overly sweet. The tasting notes at the store said it was a balance between smokey and sweet and I can kind of see where they were going with that. Although the smoke is subtle, it is there and it compliments the butterscotch and oakiness very well. Definitely less going on than in the nose but I would still consider this to have a fairly complex and satisfying flavour profile. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Finish:** A lot smokier on the finish, but its a sweet smoke. Almost like sweet barbequed ribs. This isnt a laid back finish, its in your face and noisy, but not at all in a bad way. It lasts awhile on the palate and the smokieness fades away to caramel and oak.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I find this to be a decently complex Whisky at a low price tag. I paid less for this than I did for Macallan Gold or Glenlivet 12 and I enjoy every aspect of it more than either of those two. The more I go back to nosing this Whisky the more I enjoy it, it has almost a perfect nosing experience in my opinion. The taste was slightly dissapointing after experiencing the nose but it certainly isn't bad, it just leaves a little more to be desired. However the finish certainly makes up for it and leaves a wonderful sweet bbq taste on the palate for quite a while. Out of the 6 or so bottles I own this one is the closest to empty because I find I can enjoy it at all times. The Aberfeldy 12 recieves from me an **8/10**\\n\\nScoring chart from Boardgamegeek: http://i.imgur.com/w1qFYJm.png\",\n",
       " \"Just running though whats left of my swaps. Now in the spot light is....\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 12**\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet, spicy, and dry. Reminds me of a dry wheat field at the end of summer.

Tobacco aftertaste and leaves a dry feeling.\\n\\n**Overview: 78** While I enjoyed every taste and note that I found in this whisky, I left me with a feeling that I just drank a Glenlivet and Glenfiddich 12, which while not bad, isn't amazing either. A damn decent dram and one I would drink again, but I would not buy a whole bottle. However, it would be a good beginner's drink.\",\n",
       " \"Today I'm reuniting two long lost brothers from the Aberfeldy distillery. One is the standard 12 year and the other is a 10 year independent bottling from Signatory.\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 12, 40% ABV:**\\n\\n * **Color**: Rich golden with a brownish tint.\\n\\n * **Nose**: Heathery, spicy.\\n\\n * **Taste**: Very sweet. Maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla. There's some zesty citrus character accompanying the spices in the nose.\\n\\n * **Finish**: The sweetness fades and it finishes with oak and a little smoke.\\n\\n\\n**Signatory Vintage Aberfeldy 1998, 43% ABV, natural color:**\\n\\n * **Color**: Very pale straw.\\n\\n * **Nose**: Ethanol, mint, permanent marker.\\n\\n * **Taste**: Very hot for 43% ABV. Vanilla, barely malt, toffee, peppermint. Lots of wood character.\\n\\n * **Finish**: Long lasting intense dry oak.\\n\\nNormally I'm a pretty big fan of Signatory bottlings, but in this case I have to give the edge to the distillery bottling. The biggest difference between these two was in the nose; the distillery bottling was very spicy and interesting while the Signatory was very plain and almost vodka-like, with a weird chemical note. As far as taste goes, the distillery bottling was sweeter and easier drinking, while the Signatory was drier and hotter with more oakiness.\\n\\nI was really pleasantly surprised with the Aberfeldy 12, especially as I'm not a huge fan of the Dewars blended scotches, of which this is a core component. Reminded me a lot of Cardhu, for those of you who might have tried that. I'd gladly recommend it as a tasty, inoffensive value malt.\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 12: 75/100**\\n\\n**Signatory Vintage Aberfeldy 1998: 65/100**\",\n",
       " 'I recently attended a \"Scotch Enthusiast\\'s\" tasting event at the local LCBO here in Toronto, and tried as best I could to take some detailed notes on all of the whiskies on offer.  That said, there were definitely one or two that bear further samplings.\\n\\nUntil then, a few (somewhat abbreviated) reviews:\\n\\n**Arran Sherry Cask Finish (NAS) - 46% ABV, $79.95 at the LCBO**\\n\\n**Colour:** Amber\\n\\n**Nose:** Slightly aggressive nose… Without water the youth of the spirit really comes through.  With water, more dried red fruits.  Strawberry, raisin, and apple come through.  Slight dry, grassiness.\\n\\n**Taste:**  Definitely needs the water to ease the intensity on the palate, but once added it’s a spirit that surprisingly light on the tongue.  Big, fruity arrival.  Sweet red wine grapes, dark cherries, and light, chocolatey undertones.  \\n\\n**Finish:**  A little disappointingly short, given the intensity of flavour on tasting.  Dry finish, with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and… fig?\\n\\n**Overall:**  I don’t think I’ve tried an Arran release in the last year that I’ve disliked.  This is another example of a non-aged release from the distillery that might show its youth in some respects, but still presents it very well.  It’s only a sherry cask “finish”, so only spent a short time in sherry barrels, but it was long enough to pick up some of the distinctly sherried red fruit notes that you might expect.  Certainly no sherry bomb by any stretch, but certainly some additional character added to their standard bourbon-aged releases.\\n\\n**Score:** 83/100\\n\\n**Jura Superstition (NAS) - 43% ABV, $69.95 at the LCBO**\\n\\n**Colour:** Russet\\n\\n**Nose:** Light peat, caramel, vanilla, sea salt\\n\\n**Taste:** Toffee, cereal notes, vanilla, light citrus.  Slightly spicy/peppery, with those sea salt notes still present, and not nearly as much peat influence as I expected. \\n\\n**Finish:** Soft and… unremarkable?  Not unpleasant, but nothing jumps out.  Slightly smokey, slightly salty, and a little residual vanilla, pepper and salt.\\n\\n**Overall:** I feel like this is a scotch I need to have another go at.  I didn’t get enough time with it at the tasting to really fairly judge.  It seems to have similar elements to what I so enjoy about Johnnie Walker Green, just in a more subdued way.  The question to me then is whether it’s too subdued when incorporating some of those notes I love so much in Talisker with a more mild, unpeated malt.\\n\\n**Score:**  78/100…. For now….\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 12 Year Old - 40% ABV, $59.95 at the LCBO**\\n\\n**Colour:** Auburn\\n\\n**Nose:**  Quite a sweet nose… Honey, toffee, citrus, and just a hint of peat smoke.\\n\\n**Taste:**  Light but creamy body on the palate.  Sweet honey, barley malt, toffee, vanilla, raisins.\\n\\n**Finish:** Those citrus notes from the nose finally appear on the finish.  Fresh citrus peel with vanilla, remaining honeyed barley notes, a touch of spice and barest hint of peat.\\n\\n**Overall:** There’s nothing wrong at all with this whisky, but by the time we’re 4 whiskies into the tasting, it just doesn’t hold up to some of the preceding malts.  I don’t know if it’s the lower ABV, or just that the whisky is more delicate by its nature, but it feels neutered.  If I were out at a pub and just wanting an easy sipping scotch for the evening, I could see myself going for this.  But if I’m at home or at an event with friends I couldn’t see myself choosing to drink this.\\n\\n**Score:**  76/100\\n\\n**Bowmore Small Batch - 40.0% ABV, $59.95 at the LCBO**\\n\\n**Colour:** Old Gold\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet cream, vanilla, toffee, maritime salt, and gentle but present peat.\\n\\n**Taste:** Lightly-bodied and surprisingly sweet for Bowmore.  Also noticeably young, but still pleasant.  Sweet, fresh citrus, vanilla, apricot, and oak.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Moderately long finish… The sweetness on the palate gives way to a bit of oaky zestiness, some maritime salt, and soft smoke.  \\n\\n**Overall:** My relationship with is historically hit or miss.  Many of their official bottlings are just not for me, but some of their Tempest releases have been possibly my favorite scotches tried to date.  Given my history with them, I expected to have a strong reaction one way or the other when tasting the Small Batch, but… no.  I feel similarly to the Jura… It’s a nice, fairly well balanced, entry-point to Islay whisky.  Like the Jura, my initial impression is that it hits similar notes to Johnnie Walker Green, but just not as well (for me, anyway).  That said, it’s a very pleasant and well constructed non-age statement whisky at a very reasonable price-point (as is the Jura).  So to both whiskies, kudos for that.  \\n\\n**Score:**  78/100\\n\\n**Longrow Peated Campbeltown Whisky (NAS) - 46% ABV, $93.80 at the LCBO**\\n\\n**Colour:** Pale Straw\\n\\n**Nose:**  Musty mineral funk.  Sea salt, pine needles, coconut cream pie and sweet barley malt.  No smoke, but a definite sense of vegetal peat.\\n\\n**Taste:** Sweet toffee, sea salt, wet vegetal peaty earthiness, banana, and a some kind of medicinal undertone\\n\\n**Finish:** Reasonably long finish… The herbal/peaty/pine notes remain with a sweet vanilla and milk chocolate note on the end.  I feel like there’s smoke hiding in there somewhere, but it never fully emerges.\\n\\n**Overall:** Anything Springbank makes always turns out to be an interesting beast.  There’s some really weird and funky notes in there that I can only assume are the result of the dunnage warehouses, but they work for me.  I would dearly love to try a cask strength Springbank/Longrow release, because as much as I enjoy this dram, it feels slightly watered down.  I do think it benefits from a few drops of water to help suppress a bit of the harshness of the vegetal peat notes, but it also seems to drown surprisingly easily.  All that said, a weird, wild and ultimately enjoyable whisky.\\n\\n**Score:**  83/100\\n\\n*For a little more info about the tasting itself, and other whisky reviews, I would welcome a visit to my blog: [The Green Malt](http://www.thegreenmalt.com).

       " '**Whisky Advent Calendar Omnibus Review – Whisky Network Reviews #67-75**\\n\\nMy wife is super awesome and bought me the Drinks by the Dram whisky advent calendar for Christmas, so for the month of December I was reviewing a sample a day of whiskies from around the world. I was pretty good about posting a review a day for about two weeks, but then the realities of hosting a bunch of people at my house for the holidays kicked in and I fell far behind in my reviews. The quality of my notes also decreased (particularly on a few of the days where I was busy herding family and/or children), so I’ve rolled the remaining reviews into one omnibus review that makes up in quantity what it lacks in quality. Of the remaining reviews, the majority were Scotches, but there is also an Irish whisky and an American rye, hence the cross post.\\n\\n**Scotch Review #24 / Whisky Network Review #67: The GlenDronach 12 Year Old**\\n\\n**Age:** 12 years\\n\\n**Region:** Highland\\n\\n**Distillery:** Glendronach\\n\\n**Abv:** 43%\\n\\n**Price:** $46.22 for 700 mL on Master of Malt \\n\\n**Nose:** Sherry, cinnamon, raisin, \\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, apricot, toast, slight nuttiness\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-short duration; lots of oak\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was fine, but nothing memorable. It tastes like a fairly standard sherried whisky. The finish is a little too harsh and oaky.\\n\\n**78/100**\\n\\n***************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #25 / Whisky Network Review #68: Glenfarclas 105**\\n\\nGlenfarclas 105 is a cask strength single malt from Glenfarclas. Interestingly enough, Glenfarclas 105 was the first barrel proof single malt whisky released to the public. There isn’t a lot of info out there on the whisky, but rumor has it that it is aged 8-10 years in a combination of ex-sherry and ex-bourbon barrels.\\n\\n**Age:** NAS\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Distillery:** Glenfarclas\\n\\n**Abv:** 60%\\n\\n**Price:** $61.96 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Sherry\\n\\n**Taste:** Oak, nuts, dried fruit\\n\\n**Finish:** Fairly long and nutty\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was pretty good. You definitely notice the higher proof (in a mostly good way), and it pretty much just tastes like a Speyside whisky on steroids, which is essentially what it is.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n**************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #26 / Whisky Network Review #69: Peat’s Beast**\\n\\nPeat’s Beast is a NAS blend of various peated whiskies. I assume it is fairly peaty.\\n\\n**Age:** NAS\\n\\n**Distillery:** Fox Fitzgerald\\n\\n**Abv:** 46%\\n\\n**Price:** $51.70 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Wood smoke and burnt rubber\\n\\n**Taste:** Off-putting peat, chocolate, BBQ, and salt\\n\\n**Finish:** Really long, morphing into a delicious salted chocolate flavor\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was a weird one. The taste was actually kind of off-putting at first (think the bad elements of peat) before then morphing into this tasty salted chocolate note. If this whisky avoided that initial note, I’d rate it much more highly (say high 80’s). It’s probably worth trying just to experience the roller coaster of flavors\\n\\n**82/100**\\n\\n************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #27 / Whisky Network Review #70: Rock Oyster**\\n\\nRock Oyster is an offering by independent bottler Douglas Laing & Co made from single malts from various islands such as Orkney, Jura, Arran, Islay. I’m a fan of maritime Scotch, so I have high hopes that this will be good.\\n\\n**Age:** NAS\\n\\n**Region:** Blend of single malts from Orkney, Jura, Arran, Islay, and other \\n\\n**Abv:** 46.8%\\n\\n**Price:** $46.83 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Light peat, light sherry\\n\\n**Taste:** Peat, camphor, honeydew\\n\\n**Finish:** Salt and pepper, honeydew\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was quite nice. Peat and its associated flavors and aromas are primary, but they do not overpower like certain Islay single malts. The official tasting notes don’t mention it, but I’d swear that there is some light sherry in at least one of the constituent whiskies (perhaps the Orkney). I personally view ABV’s in this range as the sweet spot for most Scotch whiskies, and appreciate that they went for this ABV despite being a blend.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n**************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #28 / Whisky Network Review #71: Balvenie Peat Week 14 Year (2003 Vintage)**\\n\\nSince 2002, Balvenie has dedicated one week a year to distilling whisky with 100% peated barley, resulting in the Peat Week bottlings. This is the second release in the series - a 14 year old single malt distilled in 2003.\\n\\n**Age:** 14 years\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Abv:** 48.3%\\n\\n**Price:** $76.51 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Peat\\n\\n**Taste:** Earthy peat and malt\\n\\n**Finish:** Peat\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Lots of peat, but in a good way and without overpowering the whisky. Probably not worth the price, however.\\n\\n**82/100**\\n\\n**************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #29 / Whisky Network Review #72: Aberfeldy 12 Year Old**\\n\\n**Age:** 12 years\\n\\n**Region:** Highlands\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Price:** $45.20 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Sherry, honey\\n\\n**Taste:** Sweet and malty\\n\\n**Finish:** Malt\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was pleasant, but doesn’t really stand out from most sherried whiskies.\\n\\n**80/100**\\n\\n*****************************************************************\\n\\n**Scotch Review #30 / Whisky Network Review #73: Bunnahabhain Stiùireadair**\\n\\nStiùireadair is a single malt from Islay matured in first and second fill Sherry casks.\\n\\n**Age:** NAS\\n\\n**Region:** Islay\\n\\n**Distillery:** Bunnahabhain\\n\\n**Abv:** 46.3%\\n\\n**Price:** $48.52 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Solid sherried malt. I enjoyed this but unfortunately didn’t take much in the way of notes.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n******************************************************************\\n\\n**World Whisky Review #7 / Whisky Network Review #74: Irish Single Malt #1 – Batch 2**\\nThis is a single malt from an undisclosed Irish distillery released by That Boutique-y Whisky Company.\\n\\n**Age:** 13 years\\n\\n**Region:** Ireland\\n\\n**Abv:** 48.4%\\n\\n**Price:** $78.62 for 500 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Pears, biscuit\\n\\n**Taste:** Pineapple, oak, nuttiness\\n\\n**Finish:** Cinnamon\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This had the trademark biscuit note of Irish whisky, but was much fruitier than I’m used to. That being said, this was pretty good, although probably not worth the price.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n********************************************************************\\n\\n**American Whiskey Review #38 / Whiskey Network Review #75: Jim Beam Rye**\\n\\n**Age:** NAS\\n\\n**Distillery:** Beam\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Price:** $17.49 for 700 mL on Master of Malt\\n\\n**Nose:** Spices\\n\\n**Taste:** Oak, rye, cloves\\n\\n**Finish:** Oaky bitterness\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Very oaky. Also tastes much more potent than 40%. I wasn’t really a fan. Perhaps this is better as a whisky used in cocktails, as I suspect it will hold up well with ice.\\n\\n**72/100**',\n",
       " \"I have been promising to do this for a while, and I finally have time!\\n\\nAberfeldy 12 was the first single malt whisky I purchased by the bottle a couple of years back. I had been drinking blends and some single malts in bars and from other people for a few years and when I finally decided I wanted to take it a bit more seriously I was recommended Aberfeldy 12 by the nice fellows at The Whisky Exchange in Borough (London), as a good choice for a beginner in my price range.\\n\\nThe bottle I am reviewing (Picture) is a litre bottle I purchased duty free on a buy 2 for £50 special (or something), but you can get a 70cl bottle at The Whisky Exchange for £30.49.\\n\\nIt is a Highland whisky by Dewars.\\n\\n\\n**Colour** \\n\\nGold/Amber\\n\\n**Nose**\\n\\nIt is very creamy and rich.

It's something that is easy to go every night and not feel too bad about drinking out of a more expensive bottle, but still very tasty. It's not really that unique I guess, I feel like any Glenfiddich, Glenlivet or Glenmorangie in this price range is similar (if not as good). I wouldn't bring it out to impress anyone seasoned, but for a friend who is just starting out I would share and recommend this bottle. Also my wife loves it.\",\n",
       " \"The new year is almost upon us! It is my resolution to make 2015 a more active year for my [blog](http://joshziewhisky.blogspot.com/) than 2014 was. As resolutions go, that's not a bad one at all. Let's jump the gun slightly and Aberfeldy 12 year old. Aberfeldy (along with some other malts in Dewars' stable) is enjoying updated packaging, which I will say is an improvement on the old presentation. Unfortunately, I never tried the old version, so I can't comment as to whether or not the liquid itself has been changed in any way. I guess the new packaging worked!\\n\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 12**\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Amber -1 (Though the telltale e150 orange is noticeable.)\\n\\n\\n**ABV:** 40% (Not even 43%?

Not bad!   \\n\\n\\n**Aroma Water:**\\n\\n\\nHoneyed Oranges, Driftwood Fire, Cereal Grains, Toasting Oak Chips, Lemon Juice on White Peaches/Pears, Creamy Vanilla.\\n\\nThe smoky side of the peat emerges now, but sweet fruit notes have taken the lead. Everything is very subdued though. At 40% and a bit young for it's age <statement>, this Aberfeldy doesn't seem to be a strong swimmer. This is a real shame, because the composition of the nose actually seems to improve with a few drops of the wet stuff, but it's just ends up too dang weak!\\n\\n\\n**Taste Neat:**\\n\\n\\nTangy Peat, Lemon Pepper, Salted Lemons, Porridge, Sawdust, Woody Vanilla, Mashed Bananas, White Peaches, Orange Creamsicle.\\n\\nPeat with salt and pepper on a relatively fresh and grainy spirit back.

Basically, I think pretty tired casks were used because this drinks more like an 8 year old whisky from mostly first or second fill barrels. So, there isn't a lot of vanilla or sweetness here. The spirit itself isn't particularly remarkable either. It's certainly not bad, but is mostly just grainy without much fruitiness. I'm guessing a quick fermentation time with aggressive yeast is the reason for this, which makes sense, as Aberfeldy is a workhorse for the Dewar's line. Luckily, the salty peat character gives this whisky a surprisingly coastal/Islay (well, Bruichladdich) feel which makes it a worthwhile dram. In the ~35 USD category, you can find better whiskies (Tomatin 12, Glenfiddich 12, Old Pulteney 12), but the peat sets it a bit apart in that price range.\\n\\nThrilled to be back and reviewing again!

Try as I may, I can't get more than just a little bit of alcohol burn out of this one.\\n\\nSo I went ahead and read a few recent reviews of this dram, and I see mentions of peat. I am not getting anything like that. Other non-reddit sources of reviews say it's used in Dewar's, it's clean and polished, and it's very sweet. Onboard 100% with all that. This is a decent dram, but honestly it's not my dram: I'm marching to the beat of a different drammer. B-\\n\\n**Score**: 80.5/100\\n\\nWould I buy it again?

       " \"Scotch review #15: Aberfeldy 12\\n\\nThe other night I included a revised grading scale in my review for the delicious new Port Charlotte 10, and in it I used Aberfeldy 12 as an example of something I’d put in the C range. Now to be fair, I don’t have much experience with this particular distillery, but I also have no real love for the Dewars blends that use it as the base spirit. But my housemate happens to like it so there was a bottle sitting on the shelf. I asked him if I could pour myself a dram, for research purposes, mostly to see if I was fair in my judgement of Aberfeldy 12 the other night based on my memory of trying it when he brought it home. For the sake of science (and trading for a future pour of something nice from my side of liquor cabinet), he agreed. \\n\\nAberfeldy 12 is a Highland single malt aged in American Oak ex-Bourbon barrels. As I stated above, it’s one of the primary spirits used in the Dewars blends. It’s bottled at 40% abv/80 proof, chill filtered & full of e150, and is modestly priced (by Ontario standards) at $60.95 a bottle. While the Highland region is where I spent most of my formative scotch drinking years, I haven’t spent too much time with Highland malts in the last 5 years or so. (I still have a soft spot for Dalmore 15 - I know it’s not worth the price, but it’s tasty despite the chill filtering and buckets of e150 used in it, and the old version of the cigar malt, too). As I am no expert on what makes a ‘good’ Highland malt anymore and despite my reservations, I am going into this tasting with an open mind. Let’s see how it tastes. \\n\\nSince I'm drinking my housemate’s whisky, I thought I’d use his style of glass as well, so it was rested 15 minutes in a Norlan. However I hate Norlan glasses and when I went to nose it, nothing really happened so I switched back to my trusty copita. It was the right choice. \\n\\nNose: Ethanol, which is weird given the low proof. Honey, fresh cut grass, melon, milky bubble tea\\n\\nTaste: Thin. Really thin. There’s not much here, but it’s pleasant enough I suppose. Crème Brûlée, chocolate milk (but like, skim chocolate milk - seriously there’s like nothing going on in terms of mouthfeel or texture). It’s so thin you can actually take large sips verging on gulps and experience zero burn and also zero depth of flavour. \\n\\nFinish: Short, boring. The lactic notes give way to the melon I noticed initially on the nose. That’s about it. \\n\\nFinal thoughts. I could drink a lot of this and not really have strong feelings either way. It seems like a perfectly fine bottle to have at an open bar at a wedding instead of the usual Glenfiddich/Glenlivet combo. I don’t think it’s necessarily better than either of those, but it’s drinkable in a perfectly inoffensive way. Despite that inoffensive nature I really don't like it at all. Not even a little. I would never buy a bottle of the stuff, and outside of the hypothetical wedding bar with no other whisky options, I don’t see myself having another dram. My housemate’s stash is secure, but I think he wins this trade hands down. \\n\\nGrade: 68 (C+). \\n\\nMy grade scale is based on the scale used at my university but modified for scotch. \\n\\n90+ (A+): Exceptional. I don’t give these grades often to my students; if I’ve given an A+ to a scotch, it’s amongst the best I’ve ever had\\n\\n85-89 (A): Excellent work. If I give this grade it means I’d never say no to a dram and likely own a bottle (or will own a bottle some day)\\n\\n80-84 (A-): Very good stuff. No real flaws, but there’s always room to grow. Daily drams fit in here.\\n\\n77-79 (B+): Daily sipper territory as well. The flaws in the malt aren’t deal breakers but I might not go out of my way to track down a bottle. Samples on the other hand…\\n\\n70-76 (B-/B): Remarkably average. 72 is the ‘expected' mean in my department, so a dram in this range is just fine.\\n\\n60-69 (C Range): Meh. You’re passing but the flaws are real and in some cases spectacular. Aberfeldy 12 comes to mind.\\n\\n50-59 (D Range): If I’ve given out a D, it means it’s just good enough to pass, or you’ve literally only gotten 50ish% of the questions right. I can’t remember the last time I had a scotch in this range, if ever.\\n\\n0-49 (F): I hope I don’t taste this. I hope you don’t either.\",\n",
       " \"Highland. 40% ABV.\\n\\n* **color:** Amber.\\n* **nose:** Orange rind/pith. Mint. Persimmon. Traces of vanilla, caramel, and honey. There's a barely perceptible roughness. \\n* **palate:** Rich in flavor but the texture is a little thin. Prunes, tobacco, and chocolate.\\n* **finish:** Pretty short. Buttery. Again, the tiniest bit of roughness, but it's not something you would notice if you weren't looking for it.\\n\\nScore: 83/100\\n\\nI should start off by saying that my impression of this was probably tainted by the fact that I was tasting it alongside a glass of Aberfeldy 21, which sets the bar very high. I found the 12 a little rough around the edges in comparison but it's still pretty good. I was surprised at how similar the 12 and 21 are. They actually look nearly identical. The 12 is by no means bad but I would probably stick to Dewar's and save a little money.\",\n",

       " '**Aberfeldy 12, 40% ABV**\\n\\nBefore trying the Tomatin 15 in my previous set of reviews (of pretty much all of Tomatin’s core range—tl, dr version is “don’t bother”), I would say that the Aberfeldy 12 was the most boring single malt I had ever tried.  But then the aforementioned Tomatin 15 staggered into my life, and the still thoroughly yawn-inducing—but higher quality—Aberfeldy 12 was dethroned from its rather undesirable pedestal, and I wanted to give an updated take on the artist-formerly-known-as-the-most-boring-single-malt-ever, aka the base whisky of Dewar’s, aka the Aberfeldy 12.  So here we go:\\n\\n**Nose:** Different fruity notes, including apple tart and liqueur.  Pastry or scone dough, honey, some salt, and several hints of straw.  Not the most exciting or complex nose, but still perfectly pleasant.\\n\\n**Body:** A bit thin and could coat the mouth better, but adequate.  Isn’t memorable at all, and the 40% ABV works against it here, I think.  There’s some substance to it, to be sure, but not enough.\\n\\n**Palate:** Lots of apple tart and honey from the nose, some brown sugar, and just a bit of spices and orange peel or coriander as well.  A decent (if again, not complex) balance of sweet and fruity.\\n\\n**Finish:** Surprisingly smoother than I remember.  It doesn’t really linger, but it also doesn’t burn either.  Still entirely nondescript, though.  My memory of that remains firmly intact and validated.\\n\\n**Price:** USD $40 at a nearby Total Wine.  Definitely overpriced, this is a $30 bottle of scotch, not a $40 bottle, but it’s not so overpriced as to be criminal, which I guess keeps with its priority of being inoffensive.\\n\\n**Overall:** Still tastes like a more boring Dewar’s.  Still tastes boring in general.  But it could be a lot worse, and the Aberfeldy 12 does have some genuine smoothness and balance working in its favor.  Its problem is that it’s a daily session drink, but it isn’t priced like a daily session drink.  I can get its qualities from Speyburn 10 or the aforementioned Dewar’s for much less, and I would, too.  77/100',\n",

The honey and barley notes recede first, followed by just a whisper of smoke.\\n\\nThis is the biggest single malt component in Dewar\\'s White Label blended scotch, and is currently the cheapest single malt, (other than McClelland\\'s) in my area at $45 CAN.  Good value and sufficient quality, it is currently my \"everyday\" dram.  I added a point or two due to the value it represents.

I bet this would be quite lovely if it wasn't so watered down.  As its is, its just mildly decent.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'Aberfeldy'\",\n",

Especially after being on vacation.\\n\\nThanks to /u/ounknownto for the sample to help that out.\\n\\nGetting down to earth means not just reviewing all the silly stuff that we all go a little bit too nuts over.\\n\\nGranted after this one that\\'s all of my next 3 reviews. But let\\'s stay in the now. Because my now right now is all stirred up, so I\\'d like to escape to a different now that\\'s not as shitty.\\n\\nA now where I try **Aberfeldy 12** was a great way to be in a different now. This award-winning dram stayed under the radar until it was bought by Bacardi. And then they... changed it to rum?\\n\\nNo, they added it to Dewar\\'s? I don\\'t really know. It\\'s like being bought by a major company somehow made it more popular. Or maybe that\\'s just what Bacardi wants us to think. I mean... they used to be from Cuba... Wait I\\'m Canadian, I go to Cuba.\\n\\nIgnore that last paranoid part.\\n\\nAnyway, the reason it started to be known after Bacardi bought it was they actually launched a Single Malt from it. Before that, Aberfeldy was just sold to them to be used in Dewar\\'s. And by \"in Dewar\\'s\", I mean it\\'s the main malt in Dewar\\'s.\\n\\nSo, thanks Bacardi! Let\\'s see how this one tastes!\\n\\n**Price:** $59.95 (CAD) at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** Highland\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Colour:** 2.5Y 7/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Peach, simple syrup, clove, ginger, lemon, butterscotch\\n\\nLight, and good for summer. From what I can remember from Dewar\\'s White Label, this seems familiar. Also has some nice Autumn flavours in it as time goes on.\\n\\nNothing to complex. Still coming back down to earth, just like the good book told me (Apollo 13: The Movie Novelization).\\n\\n**Taste:** Butter, ginger, lemon pepper, mango, nutmeg, orange\\n\\nSmooth is a word that sometimes is used a pejorative. This is a similar case. It\\'s buttery and fruity, with some citrus. Not much going on here, like a Born-Again\\'s crotch.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butter, peach, allspice, lemon pudding, cinnamon\\n\\nNice amount of spice at the end, the finish follows in the same *okay* path that the rest of the dram does.\\n\\nIt\\'s not bad, it\\'s just... butter, peach, and spice. Make a peach cobbler and you have something better with better mixture of flavours. Here they aren\\'t really melding too well.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Good, relaxing, refreshing summer dram here. Nothing more, nothing else. It\\'s fruity, a little spicy, and I can see why they released it. It\\'s not half bad. More time/abv/finishes/anything would be nice, but this is a good starter dram none the less.\\n\\n**73/100**\\n\\n*Scotch review #311, Highland review #52, Whisky network review #459*\\n\\n*1001 Whiskies to taste before you die review #224*\\n\\n*Other Aberfeldy review:*\\n\\n* [Aberfeldy 21](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1gijot/aberfeldy_21_reviewrequest/)',\n",

You have Aberfeldy and Royal Brackla OBs that seem kind of neutered and anodyne, then Aultmore, which is at least decently craft-presented (if maybe a bit middle-of-the-road and light.) All three seem like alt-Glens in a way, entry malts for the person who wants a bottle that none of their friends recognize.

But this one seems to have some promise since it’s not 40%, it’s an older bottling and it’s an independent bottling by Signatory. The signs seem good so I took a chance at a good price per dram.\\n\\nThis bottling of Aberfeldy was aged for 13 years in oak before being bottled at 43% ABV.\\n\\n* Colour: Straw Gold\\n* Nose: Fresh Red fruits, strawberry jam, vanilla, cinnamon, frosted mini wheats cereal, caramel\\n* Palate: Vanilla cream, raspberries, apple, pear, toasted oak, raisins, cherry blossom\\n* Finish: Medium to long with fresh grass and light almond notes\\n\\nWow this whisky punches way above its proof. Despite the sometimes overly oaky notes this is just really solid for the boundaries and at cask strength this whisky seems like it’d be a real gem. If you can find this around for under $90 CAD buy it if you like a good oaky and fruity Highland whisky!\\n\\n**82/100**',\n",

Rattray. Oddly enough, no one really reviews cask strength Aberfeldy releases on /r/scotch. Being a lunatic, it seemed like a good idea to get a bottle. No idea at all what to expect going into this. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** Pineapple, vanilla, melon, apricot, malt and orange peels. \\n\\n\\n**Palate:** malty, vanilla, pineapple, nutmeg, ginger, milk chocolate, apricot and honey. \\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Ends with nutmeg and pepper. Medium and warm. Honey, oak, lemon and spice. \\n\\n\\n**Score: 85.5** \\n\\n\\nReminds me in some ways of Balvenie bourbon single casks with more spice. Honestly, this is not great, but it is not bad. A sherry cask would likely help balance out some of the spice, else more time. Looking forward to see how the bottle oxidizes with time, worst case is this will make a fun mystery or sample.  Considering the bottle sat on shelves for almost 7 years, this could have gone far worse. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"Thank you to /u/throzen for a sample of this.\\n\\nAberfeldy. The name makes you scratch your head, or at least, it does for me. You look at the bottles, and start to scratch your head. Are they hipsters? Or are they following the old ways?\\n\\nOr do I give a shit? I mean, I've been thinking about it, and maybe I don't care. Yeah, it's annoying to meet someone who isn't making something, and does nothing but describe themselves by what they consume. And then I realize that's kinda me.\\n\\nSo I wonder, am I a horrible thing I hate? I mean... maybe? But I make these reviews. I write them. So I kinda am a hipster. And people like them.\\n\\nThen I think further: There's all these butchers, ice cream makers, and even the odd candlestick making blacksmiths that I shop at, that are making things, going back to old ways, and just happen to have large beards. So maybe I just hate some of the culture, and not the culture itself.\\n\\nSo does it matter that Aberfeldy is historical or just trying to do the past because they like the quality of the past.\\n\\nSo really the only way to judge them is to try their malt.\\n\\nThus I'm trying **Aberfeldy 16 A. D. Rattray** today to see what it's like. It's picked by A.D. Rattray, so this is cask strength, no old style packaging (though still cool packaging, please don't change it A.D. Rattray), and just the juice, left untouched.\\n\\nLet's see how it tastes then.\\n\\n**Price:** N/A at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** Highland\\n\\n**Cask Type:** Ex-bourbon\\n\\n**Bottle:** 265 of 281\\n\\n**Abv:** 55.5%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5Y 9/6\\n\\n**Nose:** Cinnamon, honey, nectarine, floral, lime, malt cereal, red apple\\n\\nInitial nose reminds me of Balvenie with the honey/malt notes. Lots of fruit to it too.\\n\\nNot reminding me of Balvenie is the initial cinnamon note. Quite the interesting ex-Bourbon cask, this has given more fruit/floral notes as well as the spice. Or maybe that's the spice from Aberfeldy. Lovely nose.\\n\\n**Taste:** Butter, lime, sand, pear, brine, honey tea\\n\\nLess complex than the nose, the initial floral and honey takes some time to come out, and has some tannin with it when it does come.\\n\\nYou know, like being at an orgy with a British person and they come back after a break. Always with tea.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cloves, dry, pear, anise, floral, caramel\\n\\nAnd we're back with lots of cloves on the finish. Some may say too many cloves. Actually I'd say that too. Maybe not. Given time, that goes to more anise, which I also love and add to too many things I eat.\\n\\nFloral is back. It's nice. Not as strong as a Lowland, but it's there. Again, it's like Balvenie, though the honey is more caramel forward.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I personally believe this is what Balvenie 12 Doublewood should taste like. Which is weird, since there is older, has no sherry influence, and is from a different region.\\n\\nStill the similarities are quite distinct. You have a floral/honey element, nice butter and fruit, and a good citrus element (just enough to help, not too much to suck up to whatever freaks buy orange chocolate).\\n\\nI think it tastes young for a 16 year whisky, but that's not a bad thing, more a marketing issue. It's more like a good, strong younger whisky than a moderate, calm mid age whisky.\\n\\nIf you like honey and spice, then this is for you. Or if you're a Balvenie fan, then it's for you. Quite nice.\\n\\n**82/100**\\n\\n*Scotch review #644, Highland review #108, Whisky Network review #1085*\\n\\n*Other Aberfeldy reviews:* \\n\\n* [Aberfeldy 12](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/34xo6d/aberfeldy_12_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberfeldy 21](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1gijot/aberfeldy_21_reviewrequest/)\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\",\n",

       " \"**Review #59: Aberfeldy 18 Year Old**\\n\\nSo I've had this bottle around for a while, in fact it was the bottle my dad first bought when he started getting into drinking scotch because it looked to be a relatively inexpensive 18 year old Highland whisky. So after putting this one off for a while I've decided to come back to it after some users ive swapped samples with told me how good it was. Before that let's do a quick look at this distillery. So Aberfeldy is a northern Highland distillery located on the River Tay founded by John Dewar and Sons in 1896. Aberfeldy makes up the biggest malt component for Dewar's blended whisky and only started getting into single malt offerings in 1999 when they introduced their popular 12 year old selection. It is also one of the few single malt distilleries in Scotland who carry the royal warrant to Queen Elizabeth II, although mostly due to their prominence in John Dewar and Sons blends.\\n\\nSo this 18 year old is a limited release travel retail expression released around the same time as Bacardi's Last Great Malts series which included age statement OBs of Craigellachie and Aultmore. Its sadly stuck at 40% and is likely color added although it likely is not much as the dram is quite modest in color. The bottle says that it is done 18 years in oak so I'm not sure if its purely ex-bourbon or ex-bourbon and refill sherry cask aged but I guess we'll soon find out.\\n\\n* Color: Light amber\\n* Nose: Sweet oak, bread notes, white sugar, vanilla, apple, citrus notes in the background, cinnamon, melon, grapes\\n* Taste: Some woodspice, apple, more bread notes, a tad bit watery, vanilla, some nutty flavors develop over time\\n* Finish: Medium with dryness and modestly spiced fruits and treenuts\\n\\nIts actually really nice despite the proof. I'd have preferred Aberfeldy to have a 46% release like the other Last Great Malt releases do but the complexity of the spirit is still quite nice and serves as a good casual sipper that everyone around you can enjoy. Good show Mr. Dewar.\\n\\n**Final Score: 81/100**\",\n",
       " 'Thanks to /u/smoked_herring for this dram.\\n\\nSo, back to **Aberfeldy 18** after moving some things aside! Why? Because they have a hipster based label and I need to keep reviewing them.\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 18** is a travel retail version, coming in a 1L size and enticing you to buy alcohol before you\\'ve had your morning coffee and after you\\'ve had your morning strip search by a complete stranger.\\n\\nThat\\'s called a \"Malay Handshake\" in other parts of the country.\\n\\nLuckily you and I can now purchase this product without having to go through multiple levels of security. As it bares repeating multiple times, the Travel Retail space is usually not a friendly one, with whiskies that are rare for a reason.\\n\\nThat said, I\\'d certainly be remiss to not mention some good has come from the travel retail, and sometimes a diamond comes out of the rough.\\n\\nAnd no, I\\'m not talking about my time as a diamond mule.\\n\\nSo we have to ask ourselves: If **Aberfeldy 18** made it out of the travel retail, is is because it\\'s better than that space?

It\\'s developed nicely over the years, so it\\'s not just one note. Lots of sweetness to it.\\n\\nIt\\'s a lighter nose, so it takes awhile. I think the lower Abv. is hiding some things, as every time I seem to pick up something, it lingers out the door.\\n\\n**Taste:** Lemon yogurt, caramel, brine, wood\\n\\nAgain, nicely developed citrus. Ties the taste to the nose.\\n\\nOther than that? Pretty generic, like the dorky short white sidekick in a comedy. I\\'m sure it\\'ll get it\\'s own wacky, underdeveloped female in the end though.\\n\\n**Finish:** Caramel, salt, lime, canned mandarins, oak, ginger\\n\\nSalt and caramel works here. However this is brutally short, with only a little oak lingering at the end. It\\'s most memorable note is canned mandarins, and really, that was a treat for me as a kid because I wouldn\\'t eat salad.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Maybe this should go back to the travel retail space. Or maybe they should look into some finishes. Honestly wasn\\'t too impressed, and it\\'s the weakest Aberfeldy I\\'ve had.\\n\\nOverall this is citrus and little else. Sure, there\\'s something that went on, but not enough.

Chocolate in two forms finishes this off with some milk and white chocolate.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I've never seen an independent bottling of Aberfeldy, though Whiskybase tells me that they're not unheard of. It's a distillery that I've been regaining interest in given the fun releases they've been putting out, like [this Sauternes cask finish](https://scotchandsheen.com/2021/03/06/aberfeldy-20-year-exceptional-cask-series-sauternes-finish/). This particular bottling of Aberfeldy by Cadenhead's was produced before the Dewar's group was sold to Bacardi. Overall, it's a delightful whisky. You get a nice mixture of tropical fruits along with chocolate throughout. The bit of confectioners sugar substitute is delightfully cooling as well. Overall, tasty and makes for easy drinking once watered down appropriately.\\n\\n**Final Score:** 81\\n\\n*Scotch Whisky Review #305, Speyside Review #114, Whisky Network Review #447*\\n\\n\\n*********** \\n\\n**Scoring Legend:** \\n\\n* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods. \\n\\n* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky. \\n\\n* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible). \\n\\n* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here. \\n\\n* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink. \\n\\n* 70-74: Solid, wouldn't go out of my way to get it. \\n\\n* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable. \\n\\n* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.\\n\\n\\n***********\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of my whisky reviews and reviews of whatever else I think of can be found over on my [blog](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/). \\n\\nTo view by rating grouping: \\n\\n* [Rated 96-100](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-96-100/)\\n* [Rated 90-95](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-90-95/)\\n* [Rated 85-89](https://scotchandsheen.com/tag/rated-85-89/)\\n* [Rated 80-84](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-80-84/)\\n* [Rated 75-79](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-75-79/)\\n* [Rated 70-74](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-70-74/)\\n* [Rated 60-69](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-60-69/)\\n* [Rated Below 59](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-below-59/)\",\n",

       " \"Review #30\\n\\n\\n**Aberfeldy 18 year Exceptional Cask**\\n\\n**What is it?** Aberfeldy is not particularly popular.  As far as I understand, they have a lackluster core range with a fairly cheap 12 year old expression.  Primarily used in a blend for Dewars.  This bottle was heavily recommended to me by a manager at a local big box retailer.  I rolled the dice.  Exceptional Cask is a special release that Dewar’s has run for Aberfeldy, Craigellachie and Aultmore.  These are not exclusively single cask releases.  As far as I know, this bottle spent 9 years in ex bourbon while a remaining 9 years was spent in sherry casks.\\n\\n**Bottle and Pour**:  Quaint little squat bottle.  I like the overall presentation, black text on gold background for the label, reverse scheme for the gift tube.  Gorgeous, deep color on the pour.  Nose is boozy but not offensive, sherry notes, fried bread, glaze and red jelly.\\n\\n**Is it any good?**:  Yes, unequivocally it is good.  There’s a slightly off putting ethanol note right at first sip that betrays the overall quality of this bottle.  It’s almost grain alcohol like but quickly dissipates.  What you get after that is sweet red fruits, specifically raspberry and strawberry jam.  The beignets and powdered sugar you get on the nose is here on the palate as well.  Finish is mostly vanilla and some oak influence.  Some candied pecan and sugared orange peel mulling around in the background.  The overall texture is a bit thin.  Think more a dosed sherry and you’re getting there, even if that description isn’t very flattering.  \\n\\n**Conclusion**:  This was recommended to me as a fan of Kavalan’s Vinho Barrique and that comparison is spot on.  This is easily as good as the majority of Vinho bottles I’ve had, better priced and carries and age statement.  I bought this along side the Craigallechie 19 Exceptional Cask and do not regret either of them.  /u/t8ke made the remark to me that Aberfeldy “ain’t great until it is” and this is a shining example of that.  Now I really want to track down the other Exceptional Cask releases.  I will probably stay away from their core range due to the general remarks, and I wonder if the lack of bourbon influence on the other releases will have this one stand out. \\n\\nI went to buy another bottle of this but they’re long gone from the local stores that had them.  Shame.  The only flaws are the grainy ethanol note and the slightly thin mouthfeel, but they’re not a detriment at all.\\n\\n**Score**:  8/10\\n\\n4-5 : Glad I had it, don't regret the purchase, don't see myself buying a bottle frequently but would order it at a bar or restaurant.\\n\\n5-6 : Fine, not terrible, something for my own personal well. Old standby quality.\\n\\n6-7 : Good purchase, would grab another bottle if not on a mission or the purchase isn't an inconvenience.\\n\\n7-8 : A whiskey I'd always keep an eye out for and buy.\\n\\n8-9 : Fantastic, few flaws, would be worth time money and effort finding another, secondary pricing the only concern.\\n\\n9-10 : Either does something particularly amazing or wholly unique and worth it at many price points.\\n\\n10 : Both wholly unique, particularly amazing and forever memorable.\\n\\n/u/review_bot latest\",\n",
       " 'Thanks to /u/xreekinghavocx for the sample.  This was distilled in 2001 and aged for 18 years, the last 9 of those a \"finish\" in sherry casks.

No added color and non-chill filtered. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:**   Sweet and rich, but more subdued than I expected.  Dried fruit.  Raisins.  Earthy sherry notes.  Leather.  Almonds.  Black cherries.  Dried apples.\\n\\n**Palate:**  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Somewhat sweet now.  Caramel.  Toffee.  Almond croissants.  Dark chocolate.  Cocoa powder.

I think the bitterness on the finish actually balances out the sweetness nicely.  Its a great winter dram.  Aberfeldy can make some excellent whisky.  Its a shame that their core expressions aren\\'t as good as this.  Anyhow, super glad I got to try this one.\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot \\'Aberfeldy\\'',\n",

       " \"**Review #154 Aberfeldy 18 French Red Wine finish** \\n\\nI've had an Aberfeldy only through Dewar's blends, never as a single malt.  Aberfeldy was built buy the Dewar family and has since it's construction been the core of their blend.  But today Aberfeldy releases most of their single malts at 40% with an occasional 43% release like this one.  Not exactly something that gets an anorak's heart aflutter.  And yet...\\n\\nAberfeldy is a southern highlands distillery relatively close to the population centers making it easier to visit.  From 1925-1998 Dewars and Aberfeldy was part of DCL, the precursor to Diageo, but the deal that created Diageo resulted in the Dewar's brand and 5 single malts being sold to Bacardi.  Aberfeldy has become the visitors and education center for Dewar's.  It's a pretty big plant capable of producing 2.7 mlpa.  But they also run long fermentations and slow distillations to get a sweet dense sweet spirit.\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland Highlands\\n\\n**Color:** 1.3 muscat \\n\\n**ABV:**  43% \\n\\n**Nose:**  Aromatic honey, raspberry, red cherry, baking spices of allspice, cinnamon, clove and dried ginger, red apples, fresh baked bread, slightly waxy all relatively straightforward, but rich and nosing like a higher abv. \\n\\n**Palate:** The red wine cask finish is very evident here, and it is one that works well.   Honeyed malt, raspberries, cherry, table grapes, sweetened cranberry developing into rich baking spices.  It's quite similar to the profile of an European oak sherry cask with much brighter red fruits.  Behind these big notes honey is intertwined with vanilla. \\n\\n**Finish:** Bright red fruit and spices lead out the finish and are rather sharp for 43%.  The tannin from the red wine cask results a in a pretty long but drying finish with some coffee added to those baking spices.  Beneath that layer a waxy honey lingers. \\n\\n**Rating:** 82 \\n\\n**Summary:**  I'm generally pretty cautious about red wine cask whiskies because the red wine casks can go in unexpected directions.  But this is a great example where it can and does work.  Aberfeldy is known for a heavier than expect spirit for the ABV.   It's meant to have some weight to it and I think that shows through here.\\n\\n**Review #155 Aberfeldy 20 Exceptional Cask Series Saurternes Finish Batch AB3099**\\n\\nContinuing the Aberfeldy train today we have an Exceptional Cask Series.  I once had this bottle in hand ready to check out at the store when I looked and saw it was only 43%.  Most of the ECS bottlings have been higher strength if not cask strength.  At the price point of the bottle I decided to pass at the last moment.  However, most of the reviews have said this has a richness not common with a 43% abv.  Thanks again to u/zSolaris for pouring these drams for me.  Let's check it out firsthand.\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland/Highlands \\n\\n**Color:** 1.1 burnished \\n\\n**ABV:**  43% \\n\\n**Nose:**  Honey and flowers.  Just loads of them.  White peach, whipped cream, delicate tea notes, orange cordial, toasted spices, furniture wax \\n\\n**Palate:**  Gentle arrival on honey, honeycomb, white peach, assam tea, orange zest, allspice, caramel, musty papers, cinnamon, dry ginger, nutmeg, beeswax, and a bit of melon \\n\\n**Finish:**  Low intensity but long duration on orange zest, cinnamon, tea, musty honey \\n\\n**Rating:** 85 \\n\\n**Summary:**  Really tasty and in general time focused this dram.  Lovely peach notes I think are coming from the cask and more dense than one would expect from the ABV.  And while the finish wasn't as sharp or grippy, it did carry a long duration with a soft touch.  I won't buy a bottle just because I'm out of space.  I would recommend it though.  I'm really glad I got to try this.\\n\\n**Review #156 Aberfeldy 18 Cadenheads Small Batch 56.4% 1997** \\n\\nAlright, lets strip away the cask finishes and amp up the volume.

I think this is a really good representation of the raw spirit.  Quite dense on light flavors, but in these casks it drinks like a 10 year old with certain characteristics I think only time can expose like the melon note.  As I was doing research on IB Aberfeldy it seems some weird ones get out the warehouse.\\n\\n**Overall Summary:** I've not had Aberfeldy before.  Nothing against it, but it just didn't sound very interesting with a palate know for honey and the entry releases all at 40%.  I have however made some comments recommending Aberfeldy to Dalwhinnie lovers or vice versa.  And I think there is truth to this as both really lead with honey notes.  However...  Aberfeldy is much more clean than Dalwhinnie.  Dalwhinnie has some earthy notes that stem from the worm tubs and light peat where Aberfeldy is all on bright notes of honey, grain and just hint at orchard fruits in the back.  The IB Aberfeldy was really interesting with the distinct melon notes as that's not a common note in single malt.  Older Bruichladdich being most notable for it, but it was a bit rough in spots and drank much younger than the age statement even when water was added.\\n\\n00-10 | Jepsons Malort | My face just imploded\\n\\n10-19 | Drain pour\\n\\n20-29 | Serious flaws\\n\\n30-39 | Flaws or mixing grade\\n\\n40-49 | Flawed, or poor quality\\n\\n50-59 | Average | Some flaws but acceptable\\n\\n60-69 | Good\\n\\n70-79 | Above average\\n\\n80-89 | Well above average\\n\\n90-95 | Outstanding\\n\\n95-100 | Exceptional\",\n",

That said, these days, you’re going to be hard pressed to pick up something comparable without spending a lot more, and it’s still quite good before all those comparisons come into play, so I’m more than happy I got this.\\n\\n**89**/100',\n",

The reason its labelled semi-blind is because while I didn't know what the dram is while tasting I do know what it *could* be since it came from our shelf.  Also I won’t be posting one every day as we didn’t have enough open bottles that I haven’t already reviewed recently. \\n\\nTonight we got the Aberfeldy 18 finished in red wine casks.

With a little bit of water, the earthiness fades and you're left with a seemingly generic slightly fruity whisky. \\n\\n**Finish:** Medium in length. It's an interesting (in a good way) mixture of chalk, milk chocolate, red wine, and tannins. \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Aberfeldy isn't one that pops to mind when I think of distilleries that would experiment with different, less than traditional cask finishes. So when I saw this one,  I got pretty curious. My only previous experience with Aberfeldy is with their 12 year old, which I remember enjoying. I'm not sure how much of an upgrade this 17 year version is from that. The flavors, which are a very interesting mix of earthiness and a bit of fruit, all seem like they could go up another level but never seem to quite get started. I am left thinking that this could have absolutely used a few extra percentage points as far as ABV goes. Still, it's not a bad whisky and it is enjoyable. Would I buy another bottle? Unlikely.\\n\\n**Final Score:** 79. \\n\\n*Scotch Whisky Review #248, Highland Review #50, Whisky Network Review #381* \\n\\n*********** \\n\\n**Scoring Legend:** \\n\\n* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods. \\n\\n* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky. \\n\\n* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible). \\n\\n* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here. \\n\\n* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink. \\n\\n* 70-74: Solid, wouldn't go out of my way to get it. \\n\\n* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable. \\n\\n* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.\\n\\n\\n***********\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of my whisky reviews and reviews of whatever else I think of can be found over on my [blog](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/). \\n\\nTo view by rating grouping: \\n\\n* [Rated 96-100](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-96-100/)\\n* [Rated 90-95](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-90-95/)\\n* [Rated 85-89](https://scotchandsheen.com/tag/rated-85-89/)\\n* [Rated 80-84](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-80-84/)\\n* [Rated 75-79](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-75-79/)\\n* [Rated 70-74](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-70-74/)\\n* [Rated 60-69](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-60-69/)\\n* [Rated Below 59](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-below-59/)\",\n",
       " 'Review 17: Aberfeldy 1991 (Gordon & Macphail)\\n\\n* Distillery: Aberfeldy\\n* Vintage: 1991\\n* Bottled: 2012\\n* Bottling: Connoisseurs Choice\\n* Matured: First-fill sherry butt, Refill American hogshead\\n* ABV: 46%\\n* Price: 47€ (Germany)\\n* NCF\\n\\n**Color:** Golden Straw, natural color\\n\\n**Nose:** An impressive sweetness coupled with hints of bee wax and gentle sherry. There is a very slight cooling effect on the nose which reminds me of honeyed menthol. Lots and lots of vanilla and caramel. This is quite a nose actually. It evolves after a while and is pleasant all the way through.\\n\\n**Taste:** Just as much sweetness on the palate as there is on the nose. Ripe oranges, vanilla, and toffee. For a 21yo, there is only a very slight bitterness to be found, the oranges now turn to blood oranges. \\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-long. Very sweet and warming with milk chocolate and oak tannins.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** As part of the Dewars blend, Aberfeldy is known for their smooth single malts. From what I hear, the 21yo OB is magnificent. However, at only 2/3rd of the price, while a little edgier, this one is a bargain -- and still comparable when it comes to character. I highly recommend trying it after having had a rich dinner. I found this dram to go extremely well with all kinds of meat, fish, and heavy spices. It’s not an offensive whisky, yet very enjoyable to drink. I mainly picked it up to diversify my sherry bomb and aced drams, to have something more balanced.\\n\\n**88/100**\\n',\n",

I\\'ve heard many decent things about these Aberfeldy Exceptional Casks bottlings, but unfortunately when I decided to pick this bottle up in a larger order, I didn\\'t realize that this had been watered down to 43% instead of being bottled at cask strength of some other exceptional cask series bottlings I\\'ve heard many good things about.

Extremely well balanced nose from start to finish with a great balance of sweet honey/caramel, fruit, & dark dried raisins. This continued to the palate where on the first initial sip it seemed a bit thin, but then as your mouth warms it up, it coats your mouth with this lightly waxy sweet fruity spice that just lingers. The finish is quite long lasting & reminds me of eating fruit leather that\\'s mostly ripe honeycrisp apples, but has a few ripe red & green grapes mixed in.

       " 'So I\\'ve always been a bit skeptical of the marketing term \"Exceptional Cask\" ever since Macallan decided to use it to justify charging thousands of dollars for their cask strength offerings.

The instant it hits your tongue, you\\'re hit with this oddly bitter apple fruit stem vibe that\\'s been sitting in a metallic container in the sun for a few days.

       " \"**Review #154 Aberfeldy 18 French Red Wine finish** \\n\\nI've had an Aberfeldy only through Dewar's blends, never as a single malt.  Aberfeldy was built buy the Dewar family and has since it's construction been the core of their blend.  But today Aberfeldy releases most of their single malts at 40% with an occasional 43% release like this one.  Not exactly something that gets an anorak's heart aflutter.  And yet...\\n\\nAberfeldy is a southern highlands distillery relatively close to the population centers making it easier to visit.  From 1925-1998 Dewars and Aberfeldy was part of DCL, the precursor to Diageo, but the deal that created Diageo resulted in the Dewar's brand and 5 single malts being sold to Bacardi.  Aberfeldy has become the visitors and education center for Dewar's.  It's a pretty big plant capable of producing 2.7 mlpa.  But they also run long fermentations and slow distillations to get a sweet dense sweet spirit.\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland Highlands\\n\\n**Color:** 1.3 muscat \\n\\n**ABV:**  43% \\n\\n**Nose:**  Aromatic honey, raspberry, red cherry, baking spices of allspice, cinnamon, clove and dried ginger, red apples, fresh baked bread, slightly waxy all relatively straightforward, but rich and nosing like a higher abv. \\n\\n**Palate:** The red wine cask finish is very evident here, and it is one that works well.   Honeyed malt, raspberries, cherry, table grapes, sweetened cranberry developing into rich baking spices.  It's quite similar to the profile of an European oak sherry cask with much brighter red fruits.  Behind these big notes honey is intertwined with vanilla. \\n\\n**Finish:** Bright red fruit and spices lead out the finish and are rather sharp for 43%.  The tannin from the red wine cask results a in a pretty long but drying finish with some coffee added to those baking spices.  Beneath that layer a waxy honey lingers. \\n\\n**Rating:** 82 \\n\\n**Summary:**  I'm generally pretty cautious about red wine cask whiskies because the red wine casks can go in unexpected directions.  But this is a great example where it can and does work.  Aberfeldy is known for a heavier than expect spirit for the ABV.   It's meant to have some weight to it and I think that shows through here.\\n\\n**Review #155 Aberfeldy 20 Exceptional Cask Series Saurternes Finish Batch AB3099**\\n\\nContinuing the Aberfeldy train today we have an Exceptional Cask Series.  I once had this bottle in hand ready to check out at the store when I looked and saw it was only 43%.  Most of the ECS bottlings have been higher strength if not cask strength.  At the price point of the bottle I decided to pass at the last moment.  However, most of the reviews have said this has a richness not common with a 43% abv.  Thanks again to u/zSolaris for pouring these drams for me.  Let's check it out firsthand.\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland/Highlands \\n\\n**Color:** 1.1 burnished \\n\\n**ABV:**  43% \\n\\n**Nose:**  Honey and flowers.  Just loads of them.  White peach, whipped cream, delicate tea notes, orange cordial, toasted spices, furniture wax \\n\\n**Palate:**  Gentle arrival on honey, honeycomb, white peach, assam tea, orange zest, allspice, caramel, musty papers, cinnamon, dry ginger, nutmeg, beeswax, and a bit of melon \\n\\n**Finish:**  Low intensity but long duration on orange zest, cinnamon, tea, musty honey \\n\\n**Rating:** 85 \\n\\n**Summary:**  Really tasty and in general time focused this dram.  Lovely peach notes I think are coming from the cask and more dense than one would expect from the ABV.  And while the finish wasn't as sharp or grippy, it did carry a long duration with a soft touch.  I won't buy a bottle just because I'm out of space.  I would recommend it though.  I'm really glad I got to try this.\\n\\n**Review #156 Aberfeldy 18 Cadenheads Small Batch 56.4% 1997** \\n\\nAlright, lets strip away the cask finishes and amp up the volume.  Here we have some naked Aberfeldy in ex-bourbon casks at 18 years.\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland/Highlands \\n\\n**Color:** 0.2 pale straw (NCA) \\n\\n**ABV:**  56.4% (NCF) \\n\\n**Nose:**   With water;  Honey and melons, like cantaloupe and rock melon, vanilla, a bit of porridge, slightly floral \\n\\n**Palate:**    With water; Honey, orange, vanilla, more honey (seriously a bigger second wave), honey nut Cheerios, developing into bit of black tea, slightly astringent, some of that rock melon, musty paper, furniture wax, fresh ginger \\n\\n**Finish:**  With water; Honey, melon and soft spices cinnamon, clove, vanilla \\n\\n**Rating:** 82 \\n\\n**Summary:**  Naked Aberfeldy.  I think this is a really good representation of the raw spirit.  Quite dense on light flavors, but in these casks it drinks like a 10 year old with certain characteristics I think only time can expose like the melon note.  As I was doing research on IB Aberfeldy it seems some weird ones get out the warehouse.\\n\\n**Overall Summary:** I've not had Aberfeldy before.  Nothing against it, but it just didn't sound very interesting with a palate know for honey and the entry releases all at 40%.  I have however made some comments recommending Aberfeldy to Dalwhinnie lovers or vice versa.  And I think there is truth to this as both really lead with honey notes.  However...  Aberfeldy is much more clean than Dalwhinnie.  Dalwhinnie has some earthy notes that stem from the worm tubs and light peat where Aberfeldy is all on bright notes of honey, grain and just hint at orchard fruits in the back.  The IB Aberfeldy was really interesting with the distinct melon notes as that's not a common note in single malt.  Older Bruichladdich being most notable for it, but it was a bit rough in spots and drank much younger than the age statement even when water was added.\\n\\n00-10 | Jepsons Malort | My face just imploded\\n\\n10-19 | Drain pour\\n\\n20-29 | Serious flaws\\n\\n30-39 | Flaws or mixing grade\\n\\n40-49 | Flawed, or poor quality\\n\\n50-59 | Average | Some flaws but acceptable\\n\\n60-69 | Good\\n\\n70-79 | Above average\\n\\n80-89 | Well above average\\n\\n90-95 | Outstanding\\n\\n95-100 | Exceptional\",\n",

       " 'Review #32 - 45\\n\\nHey guys ! I had the opportunity to go the a well-renowned local festival two weeks ago in Massen, northern Luxemburg, that allowed me to taste quite a lot of new drams. Most of them being exclusivities either for The Nectar 10th Anniversary (main Belgian importator) or for the Massen\\'s festival 10th Anniversary. Here are my thoughts on them ! As always, these are more \"vague\" than a proper, calm-minded review, so take that with a grain of salt. Gonna work in categories.\\n\\n**Excellent**\\n\\n* **Lagavulin 12yo CS, 2016** : was already a huge fan of last year\\'s edition, which I reviewed back then. I actually had the chance to compare both side by side. On the nose, 2016 is unquestionnably more delicate. Lots of dried sand, seashells, green olives, this is hugely refined. Quite reminiscent of the only Port Ellen I had. A sweeter side complements it, like candied lemon and pear. Palate is a little less dynamic though compared to the 2015, less extravagant. Lots of sand, blue stone, nuts, brine, … yeah, still very good in its own right. Wish I had more time with that. **~91/100**\\n\\n* **Caol Ila 34yo 1982 Cadenhead 51,1% for the Nectar** : it is known that I\\'m a fan of Caol Ila, and this one doesn\\'t disappoint on the nose. It\\'s perfectly fruity and super evolutive, with acid peaches, apples, grapefruit, even pineapple, but kept \"straight\" by a big mineral side, with some meadow grasses and sweet malt. Smoke is perfectly integrated, not a note per se. Mout is a bit less defined, more \"vague\" still sweet though with wet earth and hessian. Finish is a bit greener, complex, but a tiny bit soapy. This Caol starts superbly but loses point with each step. Still, nose is enough for a **~90/100**\\n\\n* **Craigellachie 23yo OB, 46%** : now that\\'s a surprise. Damn ! Like a filthy, greasy Clynelish of the highest grade, with clay, ink, various oils and chalky notes. Feels industrial. But also bright fruits like mango and cider to offset it. Terrific complexity, goes in every direction. Yoghurt and wax. Palate is perfect as well, with pears, vanilla cream and \"buttery\" wax but also weird touches of incense and dried flowers to keep it complex. Finish is ultra clean on creamy soft cheese, like mascarpone. What a bloody surprise ! This is insanely complex and very enjoyable at the same time. **~91/100**\\n\\n**Very good**\\n\\n* **Big Peat special Massen edition, 54,4%** : wow, what a nose. Clearly Caol Ila driven. Gravels, huge minerality, sea shells, wet newspapers, but also fleetwood, salt … you got it. Totally spirit-driven and very good at that. Palate is a bit sweeter, with great alcohol integration and quite a lot of sweet lemon juice. Does the job oh-so-well, 40 bucks for a 50cl bottle, that\\'s a bargain by today standards. **~89/100**\\n\\n* **Glendronach 2004 Sherry butt #6629 for Massen, 56,9%** : Many people were coming to discover this one, said to be very good by some local reviewer, hence the picture, which he owns. The only problem here is the nose before it aerates, it\\'s full of harsh spiciness like chick peas, paprika and juniper, off putting. But as soon as it opens, you can find classic burnt walnuts and blackcurrant. Palate and finish are flawless though, deep aromas of dark fruits, brown sugar, brownie. Typical Christmasy Glendro. Very good, only wish the nose was good right out of the bottle. **~89/100**\\n\\n* **Glendronach 2003 13yo Oloroso Butt #5490 for the Nectar, 55,3%** : very similar profile, with a more pronounced nuttiness on the palate, which is a plus, but definitely a more \"plankish\", dry nose. More austere, but alcohol might be better integrated in this one. Quality remains high. **~88/100**\\n\\n* **Glenburgie 1995 53,6% Signatory Vintage for the Nectar** : very nice and \"innocent\" nose on bananas, candy floss, lime and green branches. Sadly a bit of soap. Palate is very satisfying though, full exotic-mode, tons of maracuja and a woody astringency that\\'s anything but over the hill. Finishes like a fruity beer. If the bottle aeration is able to delete the soapy touches, that\\'s gonna be a total cracker. For now, **~87/100**\\n\\n* **Clynelish 1998 54,8% Signatory Vintage for Massen** : oh my, I love those fruity Clynelishes. Waxy for sure, but also juicy and fizzy, on bananas, pears and lemon. Mouth is really fizzy, candied, with the same fruits, the same gentle wax and some mineral touches to keep it balanced. Finish is clean and perfumed, in a good sense. **~88/100**\\n\\n* **Caol Ila 17yo Unpeated 55,9% Diageo Special Release 2015** : always been a fan of the Unpeated Caols I\\'ve tried, and this one seems to be no exception. HUGE crème brulée on the nose, unmistakable. Speculoos. Those biscuity tones seem to be part of their DNA, they really work so well. A treat. Palate takes a totally different direction with white fruits, and various herbs. Gingerbread. This change of profile was unexpected but I\\'m okay with it. **~87/100**\\n\\n* **Bw4, Elements of Islay, 51,6%** : Big salinity on the nose. It\\'s much more beasty and virile than I expected, with a big maltiness (bread crust). So far, Islay is burrying the fruits. Very good though. Palate is delicious, like mango grilled on a dirty barbecue, flint, still very salty. Finish is briny and vinegary. Very good opposition between the feminine fruitiness and the roaring Islay character. Want to crack open my Bw5 sample after that ! **~88/100**\\n\\n**Quite nice**\\n\\n* **Longmorn 24 1992 51,3% Signatory Vintage for Massen** : good one, but clearly less sherried than the preview\\'s pictures hinted (color-wise). Quite dry and austere, but don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s still very pleasurable. Revolves around 3 themes : macerated raisins, dry wood, and beef broth. Does the job. And good age/price ratio (around 120$). **~86/100**\\n\\n* **Aberfeldy 21 OB, 40%** : heeeeey but that\\'s actually a super good nose ! It must be made by bees because you can really find everything they make in this. From flowery honey to parquet wax, lacquered wood, bananas, malaga (edit : that\\'s how we call the \"rhum-raisin\" ice cream flavour here ^^), but also sweet herbs like dill and thyme. Feels \"deep\". I\\'m charmed. Aaaaand it\\'s gone, because the palate is so damn watery. What a shame that they bottled it at that strenght ! **~86/100**\\n\\n* **Caol Ila 15yo Unpeated 60,39%, Diageo Special Release 2014** : clearly not in the same league as the 2015 or even the splendid 2011 at 64%. Nose : … hello ? Really not much to be found here. Vaguely candied. Mouth : better already, on acid candies indeed (Arlequin anyone) and apple juice. Couldn\\'t tell you much else. There are better unpeated CI\\'s to be found and simply many better CI\\'s to begin with. **~83/100**\\n\\n**Not for me …**\\n\\n* **Benrinnes 1995 51,5% Signatory Vintage for the Nectar** : not familiar with Benrinnes, but I hope they\\'re not all like that. In a word : green. Lime, carambole, celery … even leek ? Seriously ? Cut grass … a diet whisky ? Almost a hint of weed. I\\'m lost here. Palate is in the same vein, green, bitter and astringent. Feels like an unbalanced Lowlander. Quick, pass me some water … **~78/100**\\n\\nThat\\'s it guys ! Hope you enjoyed, and see you soon !\\n',\n",

Not much oomph here, this is a gentle, balanced, aged, elegant dram.\\n\\n**Finish:** disappears quickly in the back of the throat, then a slow ember glows for a bit, but fades after a few seconds.  There is residual burnt sugar sweetness on the tongue, some salty toffee, a little white pepper heat left on the sides of the tongue.  Kind of a weak finish.  Hmm… yeah, it’s a quick finish.\\n\\n**Score: ~~85~~  87/100**  \\n[Edit: I finished the dram.  It deserved a couple more points for the combination of flavors making my mouth water so much]\\n\\n**Buy a full bottle?** No\\n\\n**Closing Thoughts:** It’s good, but it’s not worth the price of admission.  It loses points for that vinegar note in the nose, a straightforward palate (I prefer a more robust flavor profile), and a weak finish.  For the price ($158/bottle) I could be drinking something thoroughly amazing. I can see this being a good dram for quiet contemplation, sitting by the fire on an autumn night - a very mellow way to end the day.   Mellow, gentle, balanced, well-behaved, overpriced.\\n*****',\n",
       " 'Scotch review #24 - Aberfeldy 21\\n\\nA couple months ago I reviewed Aberfeldy 12, which is in my mind a perfectly ordinary C level scotch. It doesn’t do anything that badly but it certainly doesn’t do anything well. Mostly I find it to be a flat, boring and simple single malt. However a friend of mine really seems to like this distillery and indeed all of the Dewars/Bacardi single malts that make up the heart of the Dewars blend. He was recently on vacation and picked up a bottle of this much older Aberfeldy along with an Auchentoshan 21 for dirt cheap. It made me wonder if perhaps a few more years in oak would do this delicate albeit boring malt any good. \\n\\nLet’s find out. \\n\\nThe vitals: aged 21 years in a blend of first fill casks of an unknown type, refill hogsheads and sherry butts also of an unknown type.\\n\\n40% abv, chill filtered and colour added. \\n\\nRested 10 minutes\\n\\nNose: honey, honeydew melon, grass, tangerine peel\\n\\nMouthfeel: watery, thin, flat. \\n\\nTaste: orange, caramel, dairy milk chocolate bars, a hint of tobacco spice \\n\\nFinish: Disappointment. Peaches and cream, a slight wisp of caramel and tobacco and then poof, gone. It leaves a faintly bitter tobacco aftertaste but even that is incredibly light and unassuming. \\n\\nConclusion: Nope, I just don’t like this distillery at all. I think maybe at a slightly higher proof it would be a nice, summery dessert dram. It’s not too sweet, not too fruity, not too spicy and entirely inoffensive. The trouble is at the price this stuff goes for in Ontario ($250 CAD), there are so many better things to try. Thankfully my friend paid $85USD for it. \\n\\nReally this stuff is so light and simple that you really don’t get the sense that it’s 21 years old. I’m sure some folks really like the light, fruit forward nose, smooth mouthfeel and gentle tobacco finish flavour profile, but I guess I’m not one of those people. And at $250/bottle it’s quite simply a terrible value. Hard pass, unless my friend offers me another dram to help him kill the bottle. \\n\\n\\nGrade: 72 (B-). It’s fine, I guess. Better than the 12, but a terrible value for the money and just sort of flat. \\n\\n',\n",
       " \"Hello /r/scotch- here with my seventy-fifth review.  I recently acquired this through a swap with /u/chjmor.

Abundant in waxy citrus (thanks /u/theboy002 for help with the wax note). \\n\\n**Finish** Loads of cocoa with some nice malt & oak - quite long\\n\\n**Balance** Complex with everything coming together nicely\\n\\n**Rating 91/100:** I must admit, the first time I tried this a few weeks ago when I opened it, I was pretty underwhelmed. I don't know if it changed slightly after opening, or if my palate was a little more fresh this go around, but it has definitely improved. It is sadly underproofed at 40% though, but it has an impressive complexity for something so diluted. I'd love to taste this at 50-55%. \\n\\n**Value for the money** I got this in a trade, but it goes for anywhere from $100-150 from what I've seen. It is very borderline for me at that price - there are so many good competitors in that price range, so I can't say this is an easy buy, but I don't think it's a ripoff for a 21 year single malt.\",\n",

       " \"I recently had a nice night of drams and great company out at my favourite whisky pub in Toronto, Feather's. And like each time I go there, I have a few great drams and do some reviews.\\n\\nFor this trip I polled /r/Scotch to find what the community would recommend, and a great number of awesome people responded. Thank you all again.\\n\\nUnfortunately I'm in a leaner month, as summer is coming up and that always saps my wallet quite hard, so I wasn't able to partake in all of the Scotches recommended to me. I'll be looking for them in the future.\\n\\nThe three I was able to have (and not be too hungover the next day) were:\\n\\n* **Aberfeldy 21**\\n* Balvenie 14 year Carribean Cask (for the community review)\\n* Glenglassaugh 1983 Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice\\n\\nUp first, a very good Highland: **Aberfeldy 21**. This is my first time trying an Aberfeldy, and I was a little reluctant to delve into it. I'm not the biggest Highland fan. Actually, I've said multiple times that it's my least favourite Scotch region and usually lets me down unless the bottle is way too expensive, and even then usually doesn't live up to Cambeltons or Islays.\\n\\nLet's see if this lives up to the hype. I'm also doing this as it was requested in the Scotch Request area.\\n\\n**Region:** Highland\\n\\n**Abv:** This is a quandry.... I called up the bar and they said it was 50%.... however I can't find anything on an Aberfeldy 21 year that is 50%. So thus I'm confused and may have drank a unicorn.\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\\n\\n**Colour:** Champagne\\n\\n**Nose:** Light floral, mango, violets, lemon/lime, the beach on a lake, vanilla, oranges, 2x4 made of cedar, latte, banana\\n\\nReminds me of one of those 50's beach parties that you see on TV. Except I believe in the nose instead of what you see on those movies, which you don't believe as you know they end in racial segregation, unprotected, probably bad sex, and most likely alcohol poisoning.\\n\\nI'll have you know that Scotch usually only ends in 2 of the 3.\\n\\nBack to the Scotch: Really nice, fruity nose on this one. Reminds me more of some nice Lowlands I've had, very faint at first and takes awhile to open up.\\n\\n**Taste:** Honey, jalapeno, lime, mango, grass, mint, grape, sea air, bitter orange, chocolate milk, lychee\\n\\nA little bit bitter at first, however this leads to a creamy flavour once it breathes, which the fruit pairing nicely with each portion. Almost tastes too sweet, like Drambuie, though I like things that are very sweet, so that's a bonus for me.\\n\\n**Finish:** Lime, kiwi, oak, cocoa, celery root, canola oil, truffles, little burn, pears, cilantro, white chocolate, toffee, very bitter\\n\\nMore fruit, and the earthiness that you usually look for is now there. My main problem is the bitterness, and that's where this dram starts losing points. I'm fine with a little bit of bitter as contrast, and it was good in the taste, however the finish tastes like it was dumped at prom and never go over it and brings it up at work every damn day and never dates because of it.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is one of the best Highlands I've ever had. It has a complex nose, a good balanced taste that evolves over time, and.. well, a super bitter taste that lets you down a little bit. Everyone should try this one. It is really where Highlands should aim. The terroir is exemplified well, and it's quite good.\\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\n*Scotch Review #47*\",\n",

First impression: \"wow, that\\'s really acid\". Concentrated mix of fruits.. lemon (mostly), orange, peach. Some sherry hints far in the background. I\\'m having a hard time picking up flavours.. Some leather, grass again, and maybe wet wood? This expression is definitly not smooth, it\\'s actually kinda harsh, not that it\\'s a bad thing, though! Short and dry finish.\\n\\nTaste: 60/75 Too acid! It probably masks some of the lighter flavours. I was expecting a lot more sherry and \"depth\" from Aberlour. It seems to me like it needs more maturation.\\n\\nValue: 12/15 At the price this whisky is sold at ($40 in Canada), it\\'s competing against lots of blends and very few single malts.

Apricot and red apples. Toffee. Clementines. Slight green wood. Light cloves.\\n\\nWarm, malty and sweet. Lots of fruits, a subtle sherry influence, but definitely some bourbon cask sweetness too. It's pretty standard for a Speyside, but still pretty good. \\n\\n**Taste**: Thin mouthfeel, slightly prickly. Malty sweetness. Fruity sherry and red apple. Cinnamon and toffee. Light oaky bitterness. Very drinkable.\\n\\nThe 40% ABV and chill-filtration is pretty obvious in the thin body, but the rest of it is quite alright. Not amazing by any means, but far from atrocious. \\n\\n**Finish**: Short length, but pleasant. Cinnamon and cloves. Red apple and citrus. Light sherry. Toasted oak. Malted barley.\\n\\nPretty standard finish for what you're getting on the palate, but that's not a bad thing. \\n\\n**Summary**: So, Aberlour 10... It's pretty standard - I've heard people say this is crap, and that's just not true. For the price I've seen this retailing at, it's a pretty good deal. In flavour profile, it competes pretty directly with Glenfiddich 15 or Glenlivet 15, but in my opinion comes out on top. \\n\\nThis is extremely drinkable, and if it's affordable around you I'd recommend giving it a shot. As a sweet, simple malt and it's hard for the light sherry influence in this to be beaten. \\n\\n**Score**: 80/100  \\n*Simple, but good.*\\n\\n**Buy Again?** Maybe someday.

I am surprised this is sold as widely as it is, as this is not at all the sort of drink that I would give to someone starting out. One to avoid. However, I will try to find some IB Jura, to see if this is bad juice entirely,  or just a poor attempt at mass produced whisky. \\n\\n**55/100**\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Aberlour Ten 40%**\\n\\nEx-Bourbon and Sherry. Apparently Natural Colour, I’m not sure though. \\n\\n* **Nose**: Sherried oak. Golden syrup. A little white pepper heat. Cloves. Star anise. Orange peel. Vanilla. \\n\\nA very nice nose! Well balanced spices and sherry. Perhaps a little on the pungent side, but a straightforward, sherry-bourbon nose. \\n\\n* **Palate**: watery. Sherry forward. Pungent. Bitter tannins and wood. Some raisins and cinnamon. Slight wood smoke. Walnuts and figs.\\n\\nA grower not a shower this, starts off a bit thin and watery, but the spices and smoke layers a bit and it’s a nice effect. There’s little of the bourbon vanilla in the taste, and this is very sherried. But you do find yourself wishing there was a little more power in this. \\n\\n* **Finish**: Spice and smoke. Short. \\n\\n**Comments**: This is a good whisky. It’s very drinkable, but the finish is short, and whilst the taste is pleasant, the notes are somewhat fleeting. It would benefit immeasurably for being NCF and a higher strength. For this reason I will definitely be seeking out the 12 year old NCF! \\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n----------------------\\n\\n**The Glenlivet 12 40%.**\\n\\nNeeds no introduction, one of the best selling malts in the world. \\n\\n* **Nose**: Very green. Strong pear, apple and underripe grape. Malt. Caramel. Heather. Very very slight charcoal. \\n\\nStrangely astringent green fruits in this. Quite biting in places, which is surprising considering the ABV. More complex than I imagined it would be, but still difficult to get excited about. \\n\\n* **Palate**: Very watery. Surprising oak here. Some creamy citrus. Fake apple. Chemical sweetener. Some smoked malt towards the end.\\n\\nFear not faithful ‘livet fans! I’m not suggesting they pollute their whisky with additives, but that weird bitter-sweet fake taste is what I’m getting off this. It’s not actually bad, just a bit odd. Again, this is a very green  tasting whisky, quite acrid. But the oak suggests to me they’ve shoved in a few older casks to balance this. Not sure it works, but this is wild speculation either way. \\n\\n* **Finish**: more sweetener. Bitter apple.\\n\\n**Comments**: This is not great whisky, but it’s alright. It’s quite weird for an entry malt to be honest, and feels like it hasn’t had enough time. That said I had some of this before I got into whisky seriously and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so perhaps (without sounding too elitist) I’ve just got used to the “good stuff”. \\n\\n**70/100**\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###Thoughts.\\n\\nWell, as the scores suggest, the Aberlour was easily the best of the three, whilst that Jura was easily one of the few, bone fida without a shadow of a doubt \"shitskies\" I\\'ve had. Glenlivet was decent, but again, not one I\\'d give to someone getting into whisky. Indeed I don\\'t think any of these are as good as say, Dalwhinnie 15, as an introduction to Scotch. However, all of these whiskies have made me what to try other expressions and IB versions, each for different reasons, so suppose from a marketing point of view, these entry-level malts do work. I will say this to those of us drinking 50 year old IB GlenAuctionOnly: go back to the cheap stuff now and again, it\\'s fascinating to see how your tastes have changed, and to see the difference in quality and complexity between these malts, and even the next rung up. At the very least it makes you appreciate more. \\n\\nThanks for reading.  \\n ',\n",
       " 'Hi Scotchit!\\n\\nAnother quick review from my modest collection.\\n\\n**Review:**\\n\\n***Aberlour 10 Year Old*** 40%\\n\\nThis is one of my favourite Speyside distilleries, mostly due to the fact that they offer very good scotch at a very reasonable price. £40 for the fantastic cask strength a’bunadh and half of that for their standard line release! \\n\\nVery popular in France, probably due to it being one of the most easy distillery names to pronounce in French thus making it more memorable and marketable. Here we go.\\n\\n**Price:** £20 for a 700mL bottle.\\n\\n**Body:** Orangey amber, thin and light bodied\\n\\n**Nose:** Zesty citrus notes, fennel, oak, red wine, not terribly complex.\\n\\n**Palate:** lemon, lime, honey, malted barley, turkish delight, peppery spices, a touch of vanilla.\\n\\n**Finish:** Sweet aftertaste, lots of honey, elderflower.

       " \"Hello! Second whisky review running off the back of my first. This time I'm reviewing the Aberlour 10. I thought I should review this one in particular as I have the [Aberlour 12 Double Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2ww5yk/aberlour_12_double_cask_matured_review_1/) to reference this against.\\n\\nI couldn't taste this whisky (or the next, which I will review after this) with my normal set up of coffee and honey water etc. so this may be a little lacking, but I'll get there eventually! \\n\\nAnyway, this is the review for *Aberlour 10. ABV 40%*\\n\\n\\n* **Colour:** Strongbow Orange, almost identical to the double cask.\\n\\n\\n* **Nose:** Sweet green apple, Methanol, Sugary pastry.\\n\\n* **Taste:** Bitter green apple, Large hit of plum like fruitiness and sugar, Sugary pastry or crumble.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Bittersweet, Pleasant smokeless charcoal (I'm not into anything smoky), Fairly short but strong.\\n\\n\\nDone. Overall fairly pleasant as I'm a big fan of sherried whiskys, however slightly lacking in that big hit of flavour like the 12 year old in my first review. Basing this score off of that one, I'd give this whisky:\\n> 77/100\\n\\nMany thanks for continuing to take time to read my reviews!\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEdit: I couldn't take the picture myself this time, so I took one from Google. The bottle in the picture says 43%, but the one I tried was definitely 40%.\",\n",
       " 'I must admit that I always assumed Aberlour 10 Year Old was basically omnipresent in the world, owing to its price tag (a downright affordable $38 Cdn., making it cheaper than both the Glenlivet and Glenfiddich) and the fact that I’ve seen it in every liquor store in Canada from B.C. to Nova Scotia. It’s so widely available that I basically assumed *every* Aberlour was big on the sherry. But, as it turns out (or at least as I’ve been told), this stuff is actually somewhat rare outside of Canada—apparently it was exclusive to France at one time, and so its presence in Canada makes sense given our language-labelling laws (which ensure bottles have both English and French descriptions on them).\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nThe specs—this is a 10 Year Old Aberlour, finished in sherry casks and bottled at 43% ABV. \\n\\n**Appearance:** Chestnut, perhaps?  Has the look of a sherry cask all over it. Rather viscous, but with a few legs still showing up when I swirl. \\n\\n**Nose:** This one blooms out of the glass and climbs up your nostrils. Dominant smell is tied in with the sherry here—quite vinous and grape-y, but also hints of fresh fruit. Strawberries at first, though they fade. Cherries. Pears. Fruitcake at Christmas (holiday spices, generally). Raisins for sure. Faint leather? Even fainter grass? Sweetness. A couple drops of water lead to a kind of caramel/butterscotch note, perhaps? Some nuttiness after fifteen-twenty minutes.\\n\\n**Taste:** Somewhat acidic and a bit fiery at the 10 year and 43% ABV mark (though smoother than I actually expected). Big on the sherry. Vinous but somewhat indistinct otherwise. Again, leather. Peppery. Faintly raisin-y. Not a lot of the nice fruitiness on the nose comes through on the palate, which is a disappointment. Tomatoes? Grass? Water tames some of the youth, but jumbles the flavours even more (just a lot of red wine)—it’s probably better that this stuff is bottled at 43%, all things considered.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Short-to-medium length, and again somewhat indistinct. Winey. Raisins and some holiday spices. Faint citrus zest (orange peel?). Faint figs and apricots.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** I’m not typically big on the heavily sherry-ed single malts (I tend to prefer the big Islay flavours or big traditional oak), so take my assessment with a grain of salt, but Aberlour 10 Year Old is a respectable-but-unspectacular whisky. Especially for the age and the price range (as I’ve mentioned—at $38 Cdn., this stuff is competing more with low-to-mid-range blends than single malts), the nose delivers in big ways—but the taste ultimately falls a bit flat for me.  If you’re new to scotch and on a tight budget, I’d probably recommend this—but less on its own merits than as a counterpoint to some of the other entry-level malts. Aberlour 10 lacks the smoothness and softness of the two inexpensive ‘Glens’, but it’s a nice low-cost glimpse into some of the interesting flavours that can be at work in a whisky (and provides an avenue for examination of how finishing can affect a whisky, and give you a chance to see whether you’re into the sherry influence). I doubt I’d buy another bottle, but I’d personally love to compare this to an Aberlour that didn’t spend time in sherry casks.\\n\\n**Score:** 81/100\\n',\n",
       " \"*Aberlour, 10 Years Old, Distillery Miniature, Speyside, 40% ABV*\\n\\nNo that's not a huge glencairn: this is a distillery miniature. Bought an arse load of samples from smwhisky.com.au (fellow Aussies check this site out) and thought I'd do one a day in alphabetical order, save a few days before the community review. Aberlour 10 is matured in both traditional and sherry casks and I believe is chill filtered. The bottle says Highland single malt whisky, but further down in fine print says Aberlour Speyside. Interesting. Broke the miniature up into 2x 25 mL samples over about 2 hrs. \\n\\n* Nose: a lot of chocolate, quite light really (it is young), oak/wood, ginger/spices, a little grainy, a little floral, fresh fruit. Suffers from low ABV methinks. \\n\\n* Colour: blergh.\\n\\n* Body: light, almost like water.\\n\\n* Palate: quite subtle, smooth, vanilla, wood, spices, some fruit (mainly apples), chocolate, bitter sweet. Delicate, but with a hint of sherry richness in the background to make things not completely boring.\\n\\n* Finish: short, fruity like palate, spicy oak \\n\\nTo be honest, rather boring. I do like many smooth/unpeated scotches but Aberlour 10 is not very interesting. Would make a good introductory scotch for beginners, especially those who don't want to do the usual Glenfiddich/Glenlivet/Highland Park 12. I think older Aberlour expressions would be better.\\n\\n>83/100 – very smooth, but doesn't really excite the tastebuds or nostrils.\\n\\nEDIT: Am I drinking Glenfiddich 15 Solera? Very similar. \",\n",
       " \"Hey there Scotchit! So, I wanted to spend a nice evening doing stuff for work and watching the replay of the  Dolphins vs  Patriots match via gamepass but, lucky me, since the game reached the second half, the wifi connection somehow fails every other minute making it impossible to follow the Dolphins getting crushed. Hence, being the clever man that I am, instead of being more productive work wise I thought, well, if life gives you lemons, drink sweet scotch! A thought Ryan Tannehill might have found useful during halftime...who knows.\\nThe contestants today are two Aberlours one being the Aberlour 10, which is discontinued, the other one being the Aberlour 12 Double Cask. Both are matured in “traditional oak casks and seasoned sherry butts”, to cite the distillery. So, it's first fill bourbon casks and Oloroso butts. ABV is the same and both are NCF and color was added. The only difference seem to be the two year difference. Let's find out if there's more to it!\\nIf you want to enhance the fun and turn this into a three-way, you might want to read my review of the [Aberlour 12 NCF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/34gdnc/review_2_aberlour_12_non_chillfiltered/) first.\\n\\nThoughts on reviews are to be found [here](http://redd.it/30hje0).\\n\\n\\n**Quick facts:**  10 yo – 40% - ≈35 € Price in Germany\\n\\n**Nose:** tart grapes accompanied by honey sweetness, baking spices, brown sugar, oak, a faint hint of your favorite marker paint – It's like the Sherry casks come first and then the Bourbon casks have their entry. Not very complex, a bit too light but still nice.\\n\\n**Palate:** I expected a sweet Bourbonish entry but the introduction was rather watery, a bit tart almost acerbic entry which then opens up to more sweet aspects, but it's not as honey or sugar sweet as I expected it, nutty, vanilla, some baking spices, very woody (like chewing matches) and somehow, well, wild\\n\\n**Finish:** Only the finish brings out the peppery touch I liked so much about the 12 NCF, a long acerbic drying finish with powerful peppery spiciness on the side of the mouth, sadly not much of the sweet aspects are present at the finish, so the nice combination of pepper and honey doesn't meet this time, therefore an intense woody, tannin taste took over and stays quite a while...\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Meh, this is not the sweet, honey malt I was looking for, and it doesn't have the nice peppery touch the 12 NCF had to me. Feels a bit like the Dolphins in the first half, disappointed, confused. There were aspects of both casks but not in any harmony but wildly muddled. I know some of my friends prefer the 10 to the 12 for exactly this wildness but it doesn't really work for me here. \\n\\n**Score: 76/100** \\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n**Quick facts:**  12 yo – 40% - ≈38 € Price in Germany\\n\\n**Nose:** Pretty dominant bourbon cask: brown sugar and vanilla first, then tart Sherry cask notes: grapes, Sherry, pears, caramel notes, burned pine nuts. Interestingly the Bourbon casks had the lead on this one. Nice and more complex then the 10 yo.\\n\\n**Palate:** Waxy mouthfeel, honey, brown sugar, very, very nice peppery touch, marchpane, walnuts, dark fruits, a tad watery, again the bourbon cask dominates and the Sherry casks add some nice but rather decent aspects\\n\\n**Finish:** Sweet, a long and dry peppery finish, \\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was what I was looking for! A nice combination between the honey sweetness and the peppery touch I found and lived in the 12 NCF. This really makes me want to try the A'bunadh. Unfortunately, my recent inventory showed that I don't have a sample of that, though I thought I did. Oh well, poor me...So coming back to what lead me here, the Abourlour 10  would be the Dolphins of the first half being crushed by the Patriots. The 12 double cask is a clear winner, even though I liked the NCF even more.\\n\\n**Score: 87/100** \\n\\n\\n\\nQuick-Info on the scores: To give you an idea what those numbers mean to me I added the table below. I kept the /100 though to keep it comparable and reviewbotable. Everything below 73 isn't really my type of Whisky even though I accept that my 68 could be your 93 and vice versa... \\n\\n100 - 96 | 95 – 87 | 86 – 78 | 78 - 73\\n---|---|----|----\\nWow! Holy mother of God! | Really, really good! | Good! | Ok! \",\n",

       " \"My first review, but I've been drinking whisky for 10 years, and have a substantial collection. I just recently discovered that reddit had an interest in whisky!\\n\\nWhen I first tried this, I already had the 19 yo, as well as being on my 3rd or 4th bottle of A'bunadh -which I love. It was in a pub, on a bartender recommendation, immediately after a couple of nice hoppy ales. Somehow that pairing works really well, perhaps due to the prominent cereal, and the beer hops filling in some gaps in the whisky, though I don't think it stands well alone. This review is based on the bottle I bought subsequently.\\n\\nWithout water, it comes across very thin and there is very little on the nose. My notes are with a splash of water, which makes a big difference.\\n\\n**Nose**: Very light and sweet. Grass, straw and dry white wine. Roasted oats, hazelnuts. Raisins.\\n\\n**Palette**: Cereals and honey, a little spiciness and more raisins. But nowhere near as full and meaty as A'bunadh or any of the older expressions.\\n\\n**Finish**: Honey and some spice, but it doesn't linger as long as I'd like.\\n\\n**Rating**: 70\\n\\nOverall, it lacks balance and substance. In the same price range there are better choices, and some cheaper blends as well. Everything that I love about the A'bunadh, or the older expressions, are not present in this 10 year old. I get the feeling that there is a large component that is aged in extremely worn-out casks. Still, it works as an excellent follow-up to an ale, or as a chaser alongside.\\n\",\n",

       " '**Aberlour 10, Speyside, 40% ABV**\\n\\nFrom our six-dram tasting at the Aberlour distillery. The 10 isn’t available in the US, so I appreciated getting the chance to try it, even though I might not necessarily seek it out again unless by default.\\n\\n**Nose:** Unusually (for me) cakey for Aberlour—cheesecake is predominant, along with baking spice and vanilla extract alongside the typical Aberlour dark fruits: plums, berries, currant, et cetera.\\n\\n**Body:** Aberlour continues to manage to feel fuller and lusher than its ABV would necessarily indicate. Tasting this blind in not knowing it was only 40% ABV, it felt reasonably well-bodied.\\n\\n**Palate:** A continued blending of the cakey notes and the fruit from the nose, but the cake has transformed into pastry or pie crust along with some salt and black pepper that I didn’t expect, and I’m not really sure if it fits or not. I feel like maybe it could, but it isn’t quite there.\\n\\n**Finish:** Tails off very quickly, leaving things rather flat for an otherwise substantive (for a ten-year-old) dram. Which, okay, it’s a lot to expect from such a young bottle, but it’s Aberlour, my expectations are always going to be pretty high.\\n\\n**Price:** Nearly 30 GBP at the Aberlour distillery gift shop, I saw it for as low as 22 GBP or so elsewhere (I think the G&M shop had it on sale at the time). Not really worth it when you have the 12 (both the standard and the NCF) to choose from at a similar price, but worth trying at least once.\\n\\n**If it were a soccer (er, football…) team:** A team like RCD Espanyol or 1860 Munich that has to share its town with a bigger, better rival. You know it’s not bad, but when compared to its big brother (and how can you not compare it to its big brother), it doesn’t hold quite the same appeal.\\n\\n**Overall:** As I implied in the price section, I think the standard 12 just edges it in overall quality (maybe it’s because I’m so used to the 12, since the 10 isn’t available in the States, but I’d like to think that isn’t the case). The 10 isn’t bad, it’s just not really worthwhile when I have the 12. 81/100\\n',\n",

       " \"A European Afternoon to you all, Scotchit. Here's an Aberlour with a\\ntwist. The twist is...a sherry finish! Omgosh! Bascially this seems to\\nbe an enhanced version of the typical 10 year old expression,\\nfinished in sherry casks and bottled at 43%. Apparently used to be\\nexclusive to the French market. I've only seen this available in\\nGermany (I paid €40) and France, can anyone confirm seeing it\\nelsewhere? Anyway here we go:\\n\\n*Aberlour 10 Year Old / Sherry Finish, Speyside single malt, ABV 43%,\\nchill-filtered, sherry cask finish*\\n\\n- Colour: Light reddish orange.\\n\\n- Nose: An initial cherries note with cocoa powder and pumpkins,\\nbecomes more fudge with a strong baked oranges aroma, worn leather in\\nthe background and a whiff of Rosé.\\n\\n- Palate: Sweet caramel, moving on to spicy fruitcake covered in\\nhoney, raisins, some coffee, then bold toffee notes all wrapped in a\\nfresh mint flavour. Quite rich, medium to full-bodied with a short of\\ncreamy mouthfeel.\\n\\n- Finish:  Red fruits, very dominant sweet malt which has a faint\\nsmoky flavour mixed in and sherried oak at the very end. Almost hot\\nbut slow satisfying burn.\\n\\nOverall this is another winner from Aberlour. Does it improve in leaps\\nand bounds over say the 10 or 12? Over the 10 I would say yes, it is\\nbolder and richer and more fruity in intensity. However, I think the\\n12 benefits from being more mellow and spice and butterscotch. The\\nsherry finish isn't especially strongly evident but this is what I\\nwould point people towards over the standard 10 year expression.\\n\\n> 79/100, would buy again\",\n",

I promise I won't be posting any others for at least a couple days (apologies for spamming). \\n\\nI wanted to try out the **Aberlour 10** before trying the A'bunadh for the upcoming community review. See, I had asked a friend to pick me up a bottle of the A'bunadh in England, as the price is cheaper there, so I had some down time waiting on the A'bunadh (he ended up buying the 12 instead, so no community review this time for me, though I'm still stoked for the 12). My Scotch drinking buddy happened to have a bottle of the 10, and offered me a dram in trade, so I took him up on his offer. \\n\\nI'll let Wikipedia sum up Aberlour distillery:\\n\\n>Although its labels read 1879, the Aberlour distillery was first founded in 1826 by James Gordon and Peter Weir. In 1921, Robert Thorne & Sons Ltd sold the distillery to W. H. Holt & Sons, a brewery near Manchester. In 1945 S. Campbell & Sons Ltd bought the distillery. In 1975 Pernod Ricard acquired Campbell Distilleries. In 2002, a new, modernized visitor centre was opened.\\n>\\n\\nWOO! Modernized visitor centre!\\n\\nAhem... on to the review.\\n\\n**Abv:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Price:** $45.95 (CAD), though I was nice enough to be given the taster for free by one of my closest friends.\\n\\n**Colour:** Dark mahogany. I'm guessing this is coloured. EDIT: Been told that it probably isn't. \\n\\n**Nose:** Walnuts, light smoke, faint sherry, vanilla, mustard seed, light strawberry/sourness\\n\\nThis took me awhile, as it was quite light. And manic. Like the Harley Quinn of Scotch noses. \\n\\nThe bourbon finish is the main note, however the mustard seed really started to screw with my head. I'm really wishing for some more sherry while nosing this. It's a nice change from what I've been drinking lately.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cashews, smoke, pear, raspberry, arugula, fennel, raisins.\\n\\nAgain, the bourbon finish is taking a lot of the flavour. The minor fruit notes leave me wanting more... I really wish there was more to this one. I don't know if it's because the balance between the sherry cask and the bourbon are uneven or if the 43% Abv. or perhaps lack of sleep.\\n\\n**Finish:** Smoke, cranberry, celery root, mint, mushrooms, almonds, floral honey.\\n\\nThe finish really helps this Scotch stand out. It's young and light, however it's different than what I've had before. The earthy flavours are quite nice (if short), and I'm finally starting to get some of the sherry I've been searching for.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** If I had to sum up what I like about this Scotch, I would say I like the idea of the two different casks meshed together and the attempt to balance out these different flavour profiles is nice. I'd also say that the finish was a random, fun gift found in some odd forest nymphs dinner. That being said, it's young, it has a low Abv, and the sherry notes aren't as strong as I'd prefer. A good starting point for someone who has never tried a sherry scotch before, or for someone looking for something different.\\n\\n**81/100**\",\n",

Unless you ask or are part of it, then you\\'ll find out.\\n\\nWhen people talk about the good ole days, I, as a Millenial, immediately think they are a crazy racist and hope for a time I only assume all white people owned all other people and women were made to dance at the slightest provocation. However perhaps my generations inability to see in black and white isn\\'t always the case.\\n\\nWhen it comes to whisky, I immediately knee jerk into believing it\\'ll all taste like heaven and everything made before I started drinking was nectar from the gods. Again I\\'m using a strawman to show my point: It\\'s not always going to be minstrel shows or handjobs and rainbows, but rather somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nOr at least I should taste it first. But probably not the handjobs. Not going to taste those.\\n\\nWait, jumped ahead again. Today I\\'m reviewing **Aberlour 10 (1990s bottling)**. What has changed at Aberlour in the last... Dear god it\\'s been almost 20 years since the 90s.\\n\\nSorry, give me a second, feeling really old.\\n\\nOkay, took some deep breaths, had a drink, can continue.\\n\\nWhat has changed? Frankly they aren\\'t saying. Some would point out, probably nothing. They may have used some peated malt back then, but not enough to find out. We know that Sherry production hasn\\'t done as well in the past few decades, and as such, the barrel quality has diminished. We also know that some distillers don\\'t ferment as long as they used to.\\n\\nHowever it\\'s all conjecture. Not to mention you can become excited at old bottle tasting, and I have been told that a malt sitting in a bottle for a long, long time without being opened can have some positive effect.\\n\\nI can\\'t say, personally. I haven\\'t been the dusty guy. That\\'s for others to say. Let\\'s just see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** Auction\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Colour:** 2.5Y 8/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Leather, vegetal, grass, strawberry, grapes\\n\\nInitial nose is leather. It\\'s not an overly fruity malt. I can see why there\\'s an assumption there was some peat in this one. Lots of vegetal and leather notes.\\n\\nAgain, have heard that, and experience some sherry casks that can give those notes too. Fruit here isn\\'t overripe. Richer notes. Grass notes too, which is unexpected.\\n\\nGranted looking back at my last review of Aberlour 10, it was more faint sherry and light smoke. This is less spice, more grass, and better developed smoke/sherry notes.\\n\\n**Taste:** Leather, grape, cherry, sand, lemon oil, macadamia, wood, caramel, lemon\\n\\nNose continues on. Given some time, more citrus, nutty, and caramel notes.\\n\\nI have to say that this tastes similar to some Aberlour, but with a twist. My assumption is a better barrel. Or maybe I\\'m just excited. I did check my pants, and that wasn\\'t showing, but I\\'m older now, so maybe not.\\n\\nNuttiness is similar to current. Again, smoke is more like leather, and it\\'s less fruit, more citrus.\\n\\n**Finish:** Bison grass, cherry, smoke, cashew, oak, rich butter\\n\\nAgain, grass note is the main flavour. Richer flavour. If the current is grass and mint and earth/floral, this one is heavy on the grass. Specifically bison grass used in some vodkas.\\n\\nI think I prefer the finish of the new one, I think, however that doesn\\'t make this bad. This ends up with way, way more butter than the new one. And as my pants scream out daily, I like butter.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** So I don\\'t know what sitting in a bottle for extra time does to a malt, because I haven\\'t done enough research. I will believe people who tell me there is some influence.\\n\\nThat said, blind, not having Aberlour 10 for quite awhile, this has some noticeable differences in cask. That I\\'m feeling confident in stating. Simple flavours have been amped up a little bit. And there\\'s a grass note that has taken the place of the celeriac note in the current.\\n\\nA must try, really tasty.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n*Scotch review #623, Speyside review #190, Whisky Network review #1034*\\n\\n*Other Aberlour reviews:*\\n\\n* [Aberlour 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/15y8al/aberlour_10_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1lggll/aberlour_12_year_double_cask_matured_review_from/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1tj9i9/aberlour_12_year_old_non_chillfiltered_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour 12 Sherry Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1bnrse/aberlour_12_sherry_cask_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour 16](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2xwncd/aberlour_16_feathers_flight_reddit_meetup_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour A\\'bunadh Batch 45](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1mb4g1/aberlour_abunadh_batch_45_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour A\\'bunadh Batch 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4yc2x9/aberlour_abunadh_batch_6_review/)\\n \\n* [Aberlour SMWS 54.38 \"Confectionery and carpenters\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/67v3c7/aberlour_smws_5438_confectionery_and_carpenters/)\\n \\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com) ',\n",

And what better way to kick in the 500th review then with a little something special!\\n\\nBack in the 90s the Aberlour Distillery did something different when they created the A\\'Bunadh range. It was one of the first distillery bottlings widely available that was bottled at cask strength and matured entirely in sherry casks that have survived up until this day (RIP Macallan 10 Cask Strength]. Since then, the series has spanned over 60 editions that continue on since it\\'s start just over 2 decades ago. However, just before the A\\'bunadh was launched Aberlour had a different cask strength bottling available only for the travel retail market. That bottling was the one that I was able to get at auction back in November, a 100 imperial proof Aberlour.\\n\\nGiven that this is \"Imperial Proofed\" it is bottled at 57.1% ABV and seemingly entirely matured for an undisclosed amount of time in sherry casks. So let\\'s see if my final review of 2019, and my 500th scotch review overall, ends my year off on a bang!\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Age: NAS**\\n\\n**Region: Speyside**\\n\\n**Cask Type(s): Sherry Casks**\\n\\n**ABV: 57.1%** \\n\\n**No. of Bottles: Not Available**\\n\\n**Maturation Time: Not Available**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n* **Color**: Amber\\n\\n* **Nose**: Lovely rich and thickly dry sherry, baking spices, clove, gingerbread, lemon peel, orange zest, apple jam, new leather, tobacco leaf, hard toffee and silky almond cream\\n\\n* **Taste**: Big chewy sherry notes, loads of buttery and oily caramels, cherry paste, plum sauce, hoisin sauce, heavy cloves, white pepper, red plums, black tea, lemon peel, cocoa dust, tobacco, worn leather and a big array of treenuts\\n\\n* **Finish**: Medium with carmalized sugars, ginger paste, fresh cream, walnuts and strawberries\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nMy gosh this is such a wonderful array of old sherry characteristics. I left this bottle to air out for a month before doing a formal review and it\\'s opened up amazingly well. Big chewy and earthy sherry notes complimented with a nice nuttiness and oiliness of the spirit makes me wish that modern A\\'bunadh could hit these highs and not be so sulphur dominated. A wonderful whisky of a time gone by that if at Travel Retail today I\\'d buy a bottle without too much hesitation. \\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n*Current Scoring System Layout:*\\n\\n*0-29: Undrinkable (E.g.: Bowmore Dawn)*\\n\\n*30-49: Bad (E.g.: Auchroisk 2009 Carn Mor Strictly Limited)*\\n\\n*50-59: Mediocre (E.g.: Benromach 10 Year Old 43%)*\\n\\n*60-69: Fair (E.g.: Macallan 15 Year Fine Oak)*\\n\\n*70-74: Good (E.g.: Kilkerran Heavily Peated)*\\n\\n*75-79: Very Good (E.g.: Balvenie 17 Year Doublewood)*\\n\\n*80-84: Great (E.g.: Deanston 2008 Bordeaux Cask)*\\n\\n*85-89: Excellent (E.g.: Port Charlotte CC:01)*\\n\\n*90-94: Magnificent (E.g.: Brora 35 Year Old)*\\n\\n*95+: Masterpiece (E.g.: None just yet, hopefully soon!)*\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n*/r/scotch Review Average=81.93*',\n",
       " 'Hey there, Scotchit! Big thanks to my good buddy u/smoked_herring for pouring this one for me!\\n\\nThis bottling is something of a precursor to Aberlour’s famous A’Bunadh, which was first released in the 90s. Just prior to that release, Aberlour put out this bottling as a duty-free exclusive. The name of course refers to the old Imperial proof system, rather than the modern American proof. Imperial proof continues to baffle me, but not quite enough to get me to google it and figure it out. u/smoked_herring picked up a (1-litre) bottle at auction last year. Let’s hope that this resembles those notoriously good early A’Bunadh batches. \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Aberlour 100 Proof.** Speyside single malt. 57.1% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Local Price:** Not available in Ontario. \\n\\n**Barrels:** No age statement. Matured in sherry casks. \\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 10 minutes.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Nose:** Bright, spicy sherry. Big candy apples (the ones in the red sugar coating), fig, muscat grapes, maraschino cherries, pomegranate, raspberries, and dried fruit leather. Lots of fragrant caramel and butterscotch, along with dark chocolate, cinnamon, allspice, and peach tea. Interesting funky flavours of furniture polish, fresh leather, chalk, white glue, and a decent amount of sulfur. There’s some sherry tartness rounding things out, as well as some dusty earthy notes. \\n\\n**Palate:** Medium-thick texture. Dried fruit up front, with an interesting tropical element, dried mango maybe. Malty and browned butter in the middle, along with hazelnuts, and raspberry jam. Luscious supple sherry on the development, with black pepper, cinnamon, candied fruits, cassis, vanilla, charred oak, and a hint of molasses. There’s a bit of a pine-like note in here. Ahh, it’s hojicha (Japanese roasted green tea)! Lots of dried fruit on the back end, along with icing-sugar-dusted pastries. \\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-length. Starting to show some youth here. Manuka honey, cayenne, red apples, more dried mango, roasted nuts, and a bit of peppermint. Lingering malt, vanilla, hojicha, and sweetened condensed milk.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Notes:** I wish the recent A’Bunadh batches were this good. This whisky has plenty of character for its age, and just enough sherry without getting to overbearing. The nutty and malty notes in particular are delicious here. The development on the palate is nice and long, and, unlike some recent A’Bunadhs I’ve tried, it’s not too hot at all. Some of the youth shows through on the finish, but otherwise, top marks all around. \\n\\n**Final score: 84/100**\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.\\n\\n60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but it can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good. Well above average.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout malt.\\n\\n90-94: Personal favourite.\\n\\n95-100: Mythical.

       " \"Ok so here's the background story...\\n\\nMy fiancee bought me this Scotch I had never heard of for my 23^rd birthday yesterday. Having never heard of this brand, I decided to do a little research. Here is what I found out.\\n\\nDuncan Taylor is a company that purchases casks from other distilleries and privately bottles them. The scotch is still aged in the distillery and remains there is it would normally do. The NC^2 range, specifically, stands for Non-colored, Non-chill filtered. Being as this is a fairly young whisky with no coloring added, this gives it a very light color.\\n\\nAll this being said, here is my review:\\n\\n*ABV*: 46%\\n\\n*Cost*: $60\\n\\n*Color*: Champagne\\n\\n*Nose*: Taking me back to holidays in my childhood, the aroma is a wonderfully balanced scent of freshly baked gingerbread with just a touch of cinnamon, followed closely by sweet, bready, cereal. Almost like a Hawaiian sweet roll and frosted flakes were combined. The nose is very light and delicate with no alcohol on the finish (If even my fiancée can nose it and enjoy, there’s truly **no** alcohol bite).\\n\\n*Taste*: Very delicate, light, perfectly balanced. More sweet gingerbread with just a touch of cinnamon. Once again followed by sweet cereal. The finish has a nicely rounded, warm spice to it without having a burn.\\n\\n*Finish*: The warm spice lingers nicely. It stays in the foreground just enough to not overpower the otherwise delicate taste. The very last flavor that is easily overlooked, as it is very faint, is a very light bit of oak.\\n\\nThis is a wonderful malt. It is very sweet and delicate, yet complex and warming. This has instantly become one of my favorite scotches I've tried. Its nose lends so perfectly to the taste and the entire experience flows along so seamlessly, it just leaves you hurrying to top your glencairn right back off and have more. At $60 per bottle, the taste justifies the price tag, though I wish my wallet was better equipped for more price tags at this level.\\n\\n*Overall*: 96/100\",\n",
       " \"Alright, I bought a bottle of Aberlour 12 year about a month ago and, after the interest in my Dr. Seuss-style review of the Duncan Taylor NC^2 Aberlour 11 year that I’ve been working on a couple months, coupled with a new moderator encouraging me to stop being a lazy ass, I decided I should write up a dueling review of the two offerings to show the difference an independent bottler can make, even when the age and scotch are relatively the same. Therefore, without further adieu, I give you **Duncan Taylor NC^2 vs. Aberlour 12 Year Sherry Cask: The Duel** \\n\\n**Duncan Taylor NC^2 Aberlour 11 Year**\\n\\n*Color:* Pale yellow like Chardonnay.\\n\\n*Nose:* Straightforward malt dominates. At 11 years old, the oak has only touched the whisky with a bit of vanilla and sweetness. A bit of spiced gingerbread. Very light floral notes with fresh apples are just beginning to become present. A touch of cherry at the end.\\n\\n*Taste:* Very light oil mouth-feel. It takes some work to coat your mouth and get a good taste. Very light and delicate, though the malt continues to dominate over the other flavors. The slight vanilla increases through the middle coupled with a bit of oak and honey. Fresh red fruits continue to play in the background and, if I did not know to look for them due to it being Aberlour, I probably would not have noticed them.\\n\\n*Finish:* Warm spice. Very agreeable finish, although it is markedly shorter than your average Aberlour 12. The malt, once again takes front seat, but the oakiness really shines. The vanilla is in the backdrop and the fruits are almost nonexistent, but faintly there if you're looking for them.\\n\\n*Overall:* Due to the lack of extra-aging in Sherry casks, this dram leaves much to be desired. The nose pretty well sets you up for everything to come with little surprises throughout. It's a very straightforward whisky, and is nicely balanced and delicate. The malt seems very overpowering, as the oak barrels have not imparted as much flavor as the regular Aberlour Sherry Casks, so the oak and vanilla you would expect tend to remain a bit too far in the background for my taste. Overall, this is a nice drinking dram, but the price tag leaves you expecting much more.\\n\\n*Price:* $60\\n\\n*Taste:* 69/75\\n\\n*Value:* 11/15\\n\\n*Uniqueness:* 3/5\\n\\n*Would buy again:* 1/5\\n\\n**Total:** 84/100\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Year Sherry Cask**\\n\\n*Color:* Golden amber.\\n\\n*Nose:* Slight Malt. Honey and ripe red fruits (red apple and cherry jump out at me). Subtle dark chocolate leads to vanilla and oak in the backdrop with a touch of spiced wine. \\n\\n*Taste:* Oily mouth-feel, much heavier than the DT, but still medium to light bodied. More ripe fruits. The apple really stands out in the taste. More vanilla and oak with a bit of honey. The malt is still present, but the other characters shine through much more boldly as it sit in the background nicely. Just a touch of bittersweet chocolate before giving way to spiced wine.\\n\\n*Finish:* Much longer than the DT and much warmer. Not offensively spiced, but the spice really takes front stage. The fruits taste a bit heavier and less fresh and ripe, much like apple and cherry preserves. Almost a dryness on the very end.\\n\\n*Overall:* This whisky is a much more rounded out dram by comparison. It develops nicely throughout the drinking experience and is fairly straightforward, but has more subtle nuances throughout than the plain DT. I, personally, really enjoy the Sherry Cask Speysides, so this is right up my alley, though I much prefer the Abunad’h, if I could afford it.\\n\\n*Price:* $50\\n\\n*Taste:* 70/75\\n\\n*Value:* 13/15\\n\\n*Uniqueness:* 3/5\\n\\n*Would buy again:* 3/5\\n\\n**Total:** 89/100\\n\\n**Explanation of ratings**\\n\\nI’m a very big fan of Sherry Cask whiskys, therefore the Aberlour 12 wins out, however it was a very close call, as the balance of the Duncan Taylor is a very strong aspect to its taste.\\n\\nThe Duncan Taylor also lost out on value, because it was too straightforward of a dram to edge out the Aberlour 12. Although, once again, the flavor profile is very agreeable and gives it a unique niche within my Scotch collection.\\n\\nThese drams are both very straightforward, so they land above average, as they have very nice flavor profiles, they both leave you wanting more.\\n\\nUnless I saw the Duncan Taylor on sale, I would have a hard time reconciling the cost versus the payoff of the bottle. However, the Aberlour 12 is so blown away by the Cask Strangth version, it will be a tough sell as well, unless the price difference between the two are quite extraordinary.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nSo there you have it, /r/scotch. My duel between Duncan Taylor NC^2 and Aberlour 12 year. If you have any other questions I have not answered, I will be happy to oblige.\",\n",

Tonight is a tasting for Glenlivet, Aberlour and Scapa by Canada Brand Ambassador Frank Biskupek . He gave a talk about age statements and the increasing number of NAS OBs on the market and the start of the Glenlivet distillery which was quite interesting to hear. After which we got down to our whiskies, one of which is a blend that I haven’t seen around in a while so let’s get too it.\\n\\n**Ballantine’s 12 Year Old**\\n\\nThis is Ballantine’s blend aged for 12 years and used mostly Glenburgie and Miltonduff as it’s core malts.

Not worth a buy in my books.\\n\\n**73/100**\\n\\n**Glenlivet 12 Year Old**\\n\\nFunny enough I’ve reviewed a couple Glenlivets and yet have never had this from their core range. This one is a standard 12 year old bottled at 40% ABV and aged in ex bourbon casks.\\n\\n* Colour: Light amber\\n* Nose: Apple, red fruit, vanilla, toffee, oak, some grassiness\\n* Taste: Thin body, vanilla, apple, some raisin, allspice, oak\\n* Finish: Short to Medium with vanilla and fruit\\n\\nThis is an inoffensive as the Ballantine’s however it’s even more so with a palate that is just too weak for me. Not worth a try or buy.\\n\\n**70/100**\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Year Old**\\n\\nThis is a re-review from a long time ago back when I first tried this whisky in 2016. It’s aged in ex bourbon and sherry casks and bottled at 40% ABV.\\n\\n* Colour: Amber\\n* Nose: Red fruit, vanilla, chocolate, sultana, allspice, bready cereal, some citrus\\n* Taste: Fresh plum, cocoa, toffee, vanilla, allspice, bread, light tannin, some nuts and sultana\\n* Finish: Medium with nut and fruit cake and spice\\n\\nStill a very solid Speyside from when I tried it last, very much a benchmark for a good whisky.\\n\\n**80/100**\\n\\n**Scapa Glansa**\\n\\nThe last one is this NAS from Scapa which is an unpeated expression aged in American oak and finished in ex-Laphroaig casks before being finally bottled at 40% ABV.\\n\\n* Colour: Golden\\n* Nose: Honey, light peat, sea salt, sandalwood, stone fruit, apple\\n* Taste: Light peat, paprika, cayenne, apple, sandalwood, lemon citrus, white pepper\\n* Finish: Medium with peppery wood\\n\\nIve never really been wowed by Scapa nor put off but for the Glansa the finish kills the experience with an uncomfortable amount of peppercorn on the finish. There are better, more well composed Scapa bottles out there that are more worth the try than this NAS bottling.\\n\\n**64/100**\\n\\nThanks yet again to The Caledonian and Glenlivet’s brand ambassador for leading this tasting!\",\n",

There's something almost comforting about it, like you're wrapped up in a blanket on a cold day with a hot drink. It has a very earthy flavor with deep notes of roasted barley.

It nose is so inviting with lots of little dessert notes, the palate has a really nice warmth to it that goes well the the roasted barley and bit of custard.

       " 'I haven\\'t had many Aberlour expressions outside of their OB which are typically pretty heavy sherry influence, so when I saw the chance to try some most likely ex-bourbon or refill cask Aberlours, I jumped at the chance because I think these expressions really give you a better example of the base spirit of any distillery.\\n\\n---\\n**Aberlour 12 SMWS 54.68 \"A Perfect Garden Party\"** / 53.8% ABV\\n\\n**Wallet Damage** - Sample from /u/sengin31 but possibly found for ~$125 USD per 700mL\\n\\n**$USD per 50mL Pour** - $8.93\\n\\n**Region/Type:** Speyside\\n\\n**Chill-Filtration:** NO\\n\\n**Nose** - Bit hot initially, like a crisp apple-ginger cider, light lemon zest, gentle honey sweet (w/ water) Less heat, more subdued, darker apple juice, more generic citrus zest\\n\\n**Taste** - Bit hot, super effervescent ginger beer, very crisp sweet apples, sweet/sour vibe, like an apple-ginger shrub mixed with a super carbonated mineral water, light fruity bitter, ginger/apple peel bitter (w/ water) Reduced heat, more flat w/ a delayed effervescent vibe on the backend, still loads of apple/ginger shrub in soda water vibe but with slightly less bitterness\\n\\n**Finish** - Lingering light fruity/sweet bitterness, fades fairly quickly (w/ water) Somehow the effervescent lingers longer here, apple, honey, & ginger mead, less bitter, hint of fresh ginger juice\\n\\n**Score - 80/100**\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - I guess the SMWS name for this is pretty fitting as the entire pour tastes like an apple/honey/ginger shrub or kombucha with effervescent vibe from start to finish.

       " 'Hello Scotchit, newbie here. I became interested in whisky a little over a year ago and tried a few drams here and there at bars and with friends. However, I didn\\'t make any real headway in terms of understanding what flavors I liked until recently, when I found this sub to look into buying a bottle (eventually decided on HP12) to celebrate passing my PhD qualifying exam. I\\'m waiting to review that one, but I decided to head to a bar and try two new and very different malts last night. Here are my newbie notes...no number reviews yet as I don\\'t feel experienced enough.\\n\\n**Aberlour 12** *likely the chillfiltered version, which would be 43%*\\n\\nSetup: Neat, from what looked like a beer tasting glass? Like [this](http://imgur.com/a/iGsSn).\\n\\nColor: Reddish amber\\n\\nNose: Warm. Ripe strawberry?

Wood, orange, cherry, honey\\n\\nThis was a warm, friendly, welcoming kind of whisky, like a comfortable armchair. Not necessarily \"powerful,\" something that wouldn\\'t be overwhelming to someone new to scotch. Definitely on the sweet side.\\n\\n**Talisker 10** *45.8%*\\n\\nSetup: Same as previous\\n\\nColor: Light yellow\\n\\nNose: Smoke, but this isn\\'t like a campfire. Grilled meat, like ribs. I could chew on this. Grass, wet sand.\\n\\nTaste: This is a lot sweeter than the nose, I think it\\'s molasses. More of that same smoke, that has got to be the peat. More of the grass and meat, a hint of driftwood again\\n\\nFinish: Medium? Campfire smoke, maybe pine. The sweetness lingers. Wet leaves. Brine.\\n\\nWell, peat is a weird flavor and takes some preparation to get used to it, but I like this one too. If there\\'s any word I would use for this, it would be \"intriguing.\" Maybe it\\'s the unexpected sweetness that helped to balance the smoke and salt.

Boy was that not necessary.  The color of the two is nearly identical (I suspect caramel coloring. I held the bottles up to the light to see how much more cloudy the Non Chill Filtered version would be, but both are nearly identical in that regard as well.  The \"legs\" on the Non Chill Filtered version take FOREVER to develop compared to the Double Cask Matured, thanks to the 5% higher ABV (honestly I\\'ve had a habit of checking out the legs on my whisky just for the hell of it, but never compared two side by side like this before, the difference was pretty damned cool).

The nose is assertive, while the nose on the Double Cask Matured is much softer.  The mouthfeel is awesome I assume due to both the higher ABV and lack of Chill Filtration.  The slightly sour notes on the nose and taste of the Double Cask Matured have gone away (I’m not a big fan of the sour notes, but quite frankly I don’t recall them being that strong before, perhaps it’s just in the comparison they really jump out, or oxidation due to it being the end of the bottle and it having sat around for a few weeks?)

Followed up by a pleasant sweetness that I actually enjoyed.  After I added a cube of ice and let the alcohol melt it away for a moment I remove the cube of ice and let it sit a while.  When I went back to it I was pleasantly surprised and what I found.  The malty flavor and the alcohol subsided and the natural flavors were much more pronounced.  A sweetness presented itself, flipped up its kilt and said, “Hey look at me….Look at me you cheeky bastard!”  \\n\\n**Finish:**\\nThe Finish was on par with the taste to some degree.  It did not linger as long as I am used to with the Islay Scotches.  However it was a pleasant experience especially after I added water and let it sit.  It had a sweet and creamy finish, but I wish it lasted longer.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\nOverall I am pleased with this one.  I don’t feel too bad spending $45 USD on it.  For my first sherried scotch, I was not turned off by it for sure.  I enjoyed it quite a bit for its price point and flavor profile.

The Aberlour distillery is known for its sherried malts and let’s see if these two expressions live up to the expectations:\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured**\\n\\nAged in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks for 12 years and then married together, this malt should provide a wide spectrum of flavors and character. Bottled at 40% ABV, ~$50 here in NY.\\n\\n**Nose**: Sherried notes hit first, and hard (Don’t even have my nose in the glencairn)! Deep fruits, almost a tangy orange note. The fruits settle down into raspberries and citrus. A floral note comes out after some time in the glass.\\n\\n**Palate**: Nice solid mouthfeel. Slightly oily. Oak notes behind fruity sweetness. Spices develop faintly. Herbs and strawberries develop near the end.\\n\\n**Finish**: Medium-Long. The strawberry stays from the palate. Orange notes fade in and out. A menthol note appears near the end and sums up the finish quite nicely. \\n\\n**Conclusion**: A well-balanced malt, as it seems both cask types suit the spirit well. However, the notes on the palate seem faint compared to the powerful nose on this one. A great beginning dram, but it has some untapped potential. I’m extremely interested in the 12 year, NCF offering, as it might unleash some of this potential.\\n\\n**Score**: 84/100\\n***\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch #39**\\n\\nAged exclusively in ex-Oloroso Sherry butts, bottled at cask strength and non-chill filtered, I’m expecting great things out of this malt after tasting the 12 year Double Cask Matured. I found this older bottling at a small store in Tennessee near my parents home and snatched it up for around $65. It’s bottled at 59.8% ABV.\\n\\n**Nose**: Sherry notes, red currants, red grapes, dates. Berry medley, with distinct strawberry and raspberry notes providing a sweet/sour balance. Candied sugars. Very slight hint of oak. I love this nose. Let’s see if the palate and finish live up to it.\\n\\n**Palate**: Creamy malt. Sherried candies, almost like a blend between strawberries and toffee. Sun-dried raisins. Citrus notes come out. The mouthfeel is jammy, heavy, and thick. The high proof provides a nice tingle, quite like the menthol in the 12 year double cask.\\n\\n**Finish**: A long lasting finish. Cherries come out and blend together with a nice citrus note of lemons and oranges. Sugared rock candies top off the finish with a sublime sweetness.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: A beautiful malt. Hands down one of my favorite malts. The palate tastes a little young with that creamy malt note, but this whisky is crafted around that sweetness. Everything seems sculpted to have a proper place. If something seems too sweet, a tad bit of sourness brings it back into equilibrium. The finish and the palate truly live up to the nose and leave me wanting to come back to this dram and discover if I’ve missed anything (I have!). Truly magnificent.\\n\\n**Score**: 95/100\\n',\n",
       " 'Why hello there, /r/scotch, I didn’t see you there. Good timing, though, as I am back with my fourth review. This time, my roommate and I teamed up and bounced ideas and impressions off of each other. I think it was a worthwhile experiment and one we will repeat (and by will repeat I mean we already have).\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Year Old Double Cask Matured** Speyside. 43% ABV. About [$53 pretax](http://cellar.com/spirit_details/131367/aberlour-12-year-old) from Schneider’s in DC. Something to note: Aberlour is apparently in the process of replacing this expression of the 12 year with a high proof, non chill filtered version. This is not that, but I look forward to trying that when I can get my hands on it, and will definitely be comparing the two.\\n\\n**Atmosphere**: Mid afternoon on a crisp, sunny Sunday. Good day for walks and coffee, and we had plenty of both in the morning and early afternoon. I had picked up a bottle of the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban for the upcoming community review, and we decided to have a bit of fun.\\n\\n**Visuals**: Golden wheat. Impressively dense coloring. The whisky maintains its golden hue even when tilting the glass and looking through the thinest slices. The whisky coats the glass before dissolving into thin legs.\\n\\n**Nose**: *Neat*: Caramel. Toffee. Apple. There’s also a delicate bit of oak here. *Watered*: A bit more delicate than neat, and brighter as well. Vanilla comes through with the water, and we both also swore we smelled citrus at one point or another, but could never quite place it.\\n\\n**Mouth feel**: Smooth and velvety. Warming, but not much burn, except perhaps a bit of a tingle on the tip of the tongue.\\n\\n**Taste**: *Neat*: Caramel. Toffee. Light, but not delicate. Fruity, not the apple from the nose. You can definitely taste the oak if you hold it against your tongue. *Watered*: Substantially more delicate. More wood. Les caramel.\\n\\n**Finish**: It starts with caramel but is quickly overpowered by wood. Mulled fruits. Bits of pepper. There’s also an earthiness here that’s hard to place.\\n\\n**Overall**: 88. This is simple and not particularly complex. However, it is also incredibly smooth, and the flavors present ring through quite clearly and with power. The roommate says it’s one of his favorite bottles. I’ll at least agree that it’s among my favorite Speysides, especially for being a standard bottling.',\n",

       " \"A few months ago I reviewed [three different Speyside cask strength whiskies](http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/01/whisky-review-cask-strength-shootout.html) from Aberlour, Glenfarclas and Macallan. It so happens that I have the 12 year old whiskies from these three distillers as well. They present interesting facets of the way that Speyside whiskies can be produced. So it seemed logical to compare them to each other.\\n\\n\\n[**Aberlour 12 Year**](http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/01/whisky-review-cask-strength-shootout.html)\\n\\n*Nose*: richly fruity - red wine, raisins, raspberry preserves or fruit leathers - slightly sour, creamy sherry, very floral, a wisp of vanilla, nougat and toffee, nutty honey, which becomes sweeter, creamier and more rounded, with more dried fruits, Oloroso sherry, and an even more pronounced floral/perfumed character after adding a few drops of water\\n\\n*Taste*: sharp, gingery sweetness up front, ginger continues throughout, fades into mixed creamy oak tannins, pepper, sherry, malt and slightly sour peat, which becomes sugary sweet up front with a slightly diminished ginger bite, gaining heat a bit further back after dilution\\n\\n*Finish*: dry chocolate, figs, ginger, peat, sherry, slight bitterness, oak, peanuts and toasted marshmallow\\n\\nThis is the older version of the Aberlour 12 Year, at 43% with chill filtration. It was the first scotch whisky I ever bought. It was on sale in Oregon for $30, which made it the cheapest I could get my hands on. I was completely unprepared for the flavors it presented to me, especially because of my lack of experience with straight spirits. I tried it a number of different times over the last year or so, but it never really engaged me until recently. It may have just been a matter of trying it in a different setting, but everything finally clicked. Unlike the other two whiskies I'll be reviewing here, Aberlour ages this whisky in both ex-bourbon barrels and used Oloroso sherry casks, then marries the two varieties together before bottling. My guess is that the preponderance of the whisky comes from the ex-bourbon barrels as the sherry influence seems less pronounced than what is found in the other two whiskies. This lets the extremely floral nose of this whisky shine over the other elements. However, the nose is definitely the highlight of this whisky. The palette is pretty decent, but the gingery spiciness is just a bit too dominant and the flavors could do with a touch of a punch-up. But hey, for a $30-40, 12 year old single malt, it's really good. This makes me interested to try the newer version that is bottled at 48% without chill filtration. However that version has also been priced around $55, at which point it's going to be tempted to pony up the extra dollars for Aberlour A'Bunadh. But if I can ever find it closer to $45, I'll be sure to snap up a bottle.\\n\\n**Glenfarclas 12 Year**\\n\\n*Nose*: raisins, dates, chocolate, malt, raspberry, fresh sherry, honeyed malt underneath, some floral perfume, which becomes slightly diminished, with more honeyed grain, retaining plenty of gentle dried fruit and floral character after dilution\\n\\n*Taste*: rich sugar and honey sweetened malt through to mid-palette, ginger spice arrives early and holds throughout, chocolate and dates come in near the back along with pepper, with the ginger bite becoming a little more gentle after adding a few drops of water\\n\\n*Finish*: pepper, ginger, chocolate, dates and malt, which becomes slightly bitter like cocoa powder after adding water\\n\\nGlenfarclas's whisky is aged entirely in ex-sherry casks, and it shows. The flavors are strongly driven by its aging, with the dried fruits and chocolate taking center stage with strong ginger in the palette and finish. However even with all of the sherry presence, it's actually a drier whisky than the Aberlour. Also, the chocolate/date/malt combo reminds me uncannily of Chocolate Brownie Clif Bars. Given that the 'Farclas often has roughly the same price-point as the Aberlour, I think it's close to a toss-up between the two. Go for the Aberlour if you want something with more malt character, go with Glenfarclas if you'd like a more sherried whisky.\\n\\n**Macallan 12 Year**\\n\\n*Nose*: moderately sweet sherry, PX/Oloroso split, red wine, raisins, raspberries, malt and vanilla underneath, slightly floral, with the raisins being emphasized over the sherry, and more vanilla after adding a few drops of water\\n\\n*Taste*: jammy sweetness up front, with a burst of pepper mid-palette and chocolate-covered coffee beans leading into the finish, with more honeyed raisins, but less expansive flavors after dilution\\n\\n*Finish*: sherried malt, edging towards bitter cacao\\n\\nThis is where the review gets slightly unfair, because I was tasting from a mini of Mac 12 whereas I own full bottles of the Aberlour and Glenfarclas whiskies. However, Macallan's 12 Year is also hands down the most expensive, reaching a moderately eye-watering price of $55 here in Oregon. I did try to get some breadth by tasting small samples over the course of a few months, so I still feel reasonably comfortable with my assessment. I wouldn't mind giving it another try, but only if I wasn't the one paying. Macallan sherry oak whiskies are, unsurprisingly, aged exclusively in ex-sherry barrels and it really shows. My initial impression was of very high proof sherry, without much else going on. After a couple more tries I was able to find some other smells and flavors, but the sherry still takes center stage. Its flavors were also somewhat less robust than the other two, which, when you also consider the small price differential between Macallan's 12 Year and Cask Strength whiskies, means that I'd strongly recommend buying the Mac CS instead of the 12 year. If you want a lower proof sherry driven whisky, the 'Farclas would be my recommendation, both in terms of flavor and price.\\n\\nLooking over all three whiskies, I think they're already arranged how I would rank them. The Aberlour edges out the 'Farclas by a bit, having a bit more complexity and a slightly better price point. The Macallan trails in my opinion, with the whisky almost being overwhelmed by the sherry. However if that's what floats your boat, it's still an interesting dram. It's just that, as noted above, I think the Cask Strength version is a much better representation of what Macallan can do.\",\n",
       " \"Alright, I bought a bottle of Aberlour 12 year about a month ago and, after the interest in my Dr. Seuss-style review of the Duncan Taylor NC^2 Aberlour 11 year that I’ve been working on a couple months, coupled with a new moderator encouraging me to stop being a lazy ass, I decided I should write up a dueling review of the two offerings to show the difference an independent bottler can make, even when the age and scotch are relatively the same. Therefore, without further adieu, I give you **Duncan Taylor NC^2 vs. Aberlour 12 Year Sherry Cask: The Duel** \\n\\n**Duncan Taylor NC^2 Aberlour 11 Year**\\n\\n*Color:* Pale yellow like Chardonnay.\\n\\n*Nose:* Straightforward malt dominates. At 11 years old, the oak has only touched the whisky with a bit of vanilla and sweetness. A bit of spiced gingerbread. Very light floral notes with fresh apples are just beginning to become present. A touch of cherry at the end.\\n\\n*Taste:* Very light oil mouth-feel. It takes some work to coat your mouth and get a good taste. Very light and delicate, though the malt continues to dominate over the other flavors. The slight vanilla increases through the middle coupled with a bit of oak and honey. Fresh red fruits continue to play in the background and, if I did not know to look for them due to it being Aberlour, I probably would not have noticed them.\\n\\n*Finish:* Warm spice. Very agreeable finish, although it is markedly shorter than your average Aberlour 12. The malt, once again takes front seat, but the oakiness really shines. The vanilla is in the backdrop and the fruits are almost nonexistent, but faintly there if you're looking for them.\\n\\n*Overall:* Due to the lack of extra-aging in Sherry casks, this dram leaves much to be desired. The nose pretty well sets you up for everything to come with little surprises throughout. It's a very straightforward whisky, and is nicely balanced and delicate. The malt seems very overpowering, as the oak barrels have not imparted as much flavor as the regular Aberlour Sherry Casks, so the oak and vanilla you would expect tend to remain a bit too far in the background for my taste. Overall, this is a nice drinking dram, but the price tag leaves you expecting much more.\\n\\n*Price:* $60\\n\\n*Taste:* 69/75\\n\\n*Value:* 11/15\\n\\n*Uniqueness:* 3/5\\n\\n*Would buy again:* 1/5\\n\\n**Total:** 84/100\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Year Sherry Cask**\\n\\n*Color:* Golden amber.\\n\\n*Nose:* Slight Malt. Honey and ripe red fruits (red apple and cherry jump out at me). Subtle dark chocolate leads to vanilla and oak in the backdrop with a touch of spiced wine. \\n\\n*Taste:* Oily mouth-feel, much heavier than the DT, but still medium to light bodied. More ripe fruits. The apple really stands out in the taste. More vanilla and oak with a bit of honey. The malt is still present, but the other characters shine through much more boldly as it sit in the background nicely. Just a touch of bittersweet chocolate before giving way to spiced wine.\\n\\n*Finish:* Much longer than the DT and much warmer. Not offensively spiced, but the spice really takes front stage. The fruits taste a bit heavier and less fresh and ripe, much like apple and cherry preserves. Almost a dryness on the very end.\\n\\n*Overall:* This whisky is a much more rounded out dram by comparison. It develops nicely throughout the drinking experience and is fairly straightforward, but has more subtle nuances throughout than the plain DT. I, personally, really enjoy the Sherry Cask Speysides, so this is right up my alley, though I much prefer the Abunad’h, if I could afford it.\\n\\n*Price:* $50\\n\\n*Taste:* 70/75\\n\\n*Value:* 13/15\\n\\n*Uniqueness:* 3/5\\n\\n*Would buy again:* 3/5\\n\\n**Total:** 89/100\\n\\n**Explanation of ratings**\\n\\nI’m a very big fan of Sherry Cask whiskys, therefore the Aberlour 12 wins out, however it was a very close call, as the balance of the Duncan Taylor is a very strong aspect to its taste.\\n\\nThe Duncan Taylor also lost out on value, because it was too straightforward of a dram to edge out the Aberlour 12. Although, once again, the flavor profile is very agreeable and gives it a unique niche within my Scotch collection.\\n\\nThese drams are both very straightforward, so they land above average, as they have very nice flavor profiles, they both leave you wanting more.\\n\\nUnless I saw the Duncan Taylor on sale, I would have a hard time reconciling the cost versus the payoff of the bottle. However, the Aberlour 12 is so blown away by the Cask Strangth version, it will be a tough sell as well, unless the price difference between the two are quite extraordinary.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nSo there you have it, /r/scotch. My duel between Duncan Taylor NC^2 and Aberlour 12 year. If you have any other questions I have not answered, I will be happy to oblige.\",\n",

I never really liked wine in the past, so the first smell to me was just rancid grapes and just \"that wine smell\" that I didn\\'t like. I pretty much just held my breath as I drank it and thought it was tasty stuff, but smelled bad. I eventually grew to like the Sherry smell and I now I fully embrace it! As for the dram itself... A decent dram but it certainly tasted quite watered down and light with its 40% ABV and all that. I was not too thrilled about how the fruity and Sherry notes didn\\'t stick around strongly enough. I thought the whole point of the double cask maturing was to have the Sherry be more integrated and less superficial. Very unfortunate because I can taste a very nicely flavored whisky in there, it just needed a slight push to give it some extra \"oomph\" to be great. Maybe I\\'ve been drinking too much Bourbon lately and got spoiled by the high strength and bolder flavor profile? But certainly even when compared to the rest of its family, particularly the 12 NCF for a more fair comparison, it just pales in comparison and felt inferior in every way possible. I was both happy and sad when I finally got to try the 12 NCF. I was glad that Aberlour really came through with a 12 year old expression that was amazing, but also sad that my bottle of regular ol\\' 12 was lacking compared to the 12 NCF. The 12 NCF, being pretty much the same exact thing except just higher strength and NCF, really did deliver on what I expected from the double cask matured Sherry monster that is the Aberlour style. Overall I really think it\\'s a decent whisky for the money that just needs a little something. Definitely try to get the 12 NCF over this.\\n\\n**79/100**\\n\\n\\nDecoded\\n\\n96-100: Perfection\\n\\n90-95: Buy on sight.

This is a pretty solid dram for the price at the LCBO.  I would lean a bit more towards the Glenfarclas 12, but that’s personal preference.  Someone once mentioned I should try the Aberlour 12 NCF.  I think it would be really good, improving the intensity of the flavours on the palate and the mouthfeel.  Overall, this is a very solid (especially for the price) everyday dram.  Not super complex, but it’s pleasant drinking and exactly what I would expect from something that is sherried.\\n\\n**Score**\\n>**82/100**',\n",

The NCF, on the other hand, actually has a fair amount of flavor density and a rather nice dark fruit profile.

       " \"Hey there Scotchit! So, I wanted to spend a nice evening doing stuff for work and watching the replay of the  Dolphins vs  Patriots match via gamepass but, lucky me, since the game reached the second half, the wifi connection somehow fails every other minute making it impossible to follow the Dolphins getting crushed. Hence, being the clever man that I am, instead of being more productive work wise I thought, well, if life gives you lemons, drink sweet scotch! A thought Ryan Tannehill might have found useful during halftime...who knows.\\nThe contestants today are two Aberlours one being the Aberlour 10, which is discontinued, the other one being the Aberlour 12 Double Cask. Both are matured in “traditional oak casks and seasoned sherry butts”, to cite the distillery. So, it's first fill bourbon casks and Oloroso butts. ABV is the same and both are NCF and color was added. The only difference seem to be the two year difference. Let's find out if there's more to it!\\nIf you want to enhance the fun and turn this into a three-way, you might want to read my review of the [Aberlour 12 NCF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/34gdnc/review_2_aberlour_12_non_chillfiltered/) first.\\n\\nThoughts on reviews are to be found [here](http://redd.it/30hje0).\\n\\n\\n**Quick facts:**  10 yo – 40% - ≈35 € Price in Germany\\n\\n**Nose:** tart grapes accompanied by honey sweetness, baking spices, brown sugar, oak, a faint hint of your favorite marker paint – It's like the Sherry casks come first and then the Bourbon casks have their entry. Not very complex, a bit too light but still nice.\\n\\n**Palate:** I expected a sweet Bourbonish entry but the introduction was rather watery, a bit tart almost acerbic entry which then opens up to more sweet aspects, but it's not as honey or sugar sweet as I expected it, nutty, vanilla, some baking spices, very woody (like chewing matches) and somehow, well, wild\\n\\n**Finish:** Only the finish brings out the peppery touch I liked so much about the 12 NCF, a long acerbic drying finish with powerful peppery spiciness on the side of the mouth, sadly not much of the sweet aspects are present at the finish, so the nice combination of pepper and honey doesn't meet this time, therefore an intense woody, tannin taste took over and stays quite a while...\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Meh, this is not the sweet, honey malt I was looking for, and it doesn't have the nice peppery touch the 12 NCF had to me. Feels a bit like the Dolphins in the first half, disappointed, confused. There were aspects of both casks but not in any harmony but wildly muddled. I know some of my friends prefer the 10 to the 12 for exactly this wildness but it doesn't really work for me here. \\n\\n**Score: 76/100** \\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n**Quick facts:**  12 yo – 40% - ≈38 € Price in Germany\\n\\n**Nose:** Pretty dominant bourbon cask: brown sugar and vanilla first, then tart Sherry cask notes: grapes, Sherry, pears, caramel notes, burned pine nuts. Interestingly the Bourbon casks had the lead on this one. Nice and more complex then the 10 yo.\\n\\n**Palate:** Waxy mouthfeel, honey, brown sugar, very, very nice peppery touch, marchpane, walnuts, dark fruits, a tad watery, again the bourbon cask dominates and the Sherry casks add some nice but rather decent aspects\\n\\n**Finish:** Sweet, a long and dry peppery finish, \\n\\n**Conclusion:** This was what I was looking for! A nice combination between the honey sweetness and the peppery touch I found and lived in the 12 NCF. This really makes me want to try the A'bunadh. Unfortunately, my recent inventory showed that I don't have a sample of that, though I thought I did. Oh well, poor me...So coming back to what lead me here, the Abourlour 10  would be the Dolphins of the first half being crushed by the Patriots. The 12 double cask is a clear winner, even though I liked the NCF even more.\\n\\n**Score: 87/100** \\n\\n\\n\\nQuick-Info on the scores: To give you an idea what those numbers mean to me I added the table below.

       " '(Image not my own, I decided not to subject you all to another grainy phone pic)\\n\\n\\nA friend, (the one who initially turned me on to scotch, in fact) picked up a bottle of this on a whim and brought it by my house for my sampling. He gave it rave reviews, which to me indicated that it was probably light, and probably sherried or oaky in character (his general flavor profile of choice). Initially it made very little impression, and then the finish began to assert itself. I was pleasantly surprised by the blend of spiced, bold character and warm, dessert notes. I picked up a bottle for myself this week and decided to give it a more thorough tasting in a private setting. What I found mostly re-affirmed my initial impression. \\n\\n\\n**Tasting Atmosphere:** Almost complete silence, late in the evening. Even the bugs seem to be holding their breath. The earlier heat of the evening is fading away, leaving behind a surprisingly crisp coolness. My room, alone, in a comfortable chair. \\n\\n\\n**Color:** Dark amber, perhaps a bit of red\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** Sour apple, honey, caramel, spice. Water increases the sour apple, brings in some hints of red wine.\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Not much to note, firm but not full. Pleasant mouthfeel, but not much texture.\\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Oak and honey hit me immediately. Ripe red apple, with some light ginger. Some caramel and burnt sugar. With water, the tastes align themselves into something familiar… shoe polish, pleasant and leathery. \\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Initially short and sweet, with a bit of caramel and lingering oaky spice. The more I drink the more the finish becomes emboldened, however. Caramel lays itself on thicker and thicker, then gives way to chocolate and dried fruits on the third or fourth sip. Extremely pleasant.\\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 84/100\\n\\n\\n**Price:** 49$\\n\\n\\n**Value:** 8/10\\n\\n\\n**Would buy again:** 9/10 \\n\\nA fantastic late night or dessert dram, rich with a lovely combination of winey, fruity, and woody character. While it did only a little to differentiate itself from other, similar sherried speyside drams, what little it did really impressed me, with caramel and chocolate notes I don’t normally associate with something this woody. The lingering chocolate character of the finish in particular sold me on this one. If you’re looking for something to end your evening with an old leather arm-chair dessert dram, this is your man. Only thing keeping it from being rated higher is its similarity to other, similarly priced speyside offerings. Still, very worth checking out if you like caramel/chocolate notes in your scotch. \\n\\n',\n",

       " \"**Aberlour Mega-Review** (#5,6,7,8)\\n\\nI am a huge fan of the sherried malts. The Aberlour 12 Double Cask was one of the first *good* scotches that I had the pleasure of receiving as a gift. It lifted me out of the Dewar's and Cutty Sark gutters I was laying in. For this reason Aberlour has a special place on my shelf (also a very meaningful gift). I decided to explore the Aberlour series as best as I could given Oregon's lack of selection. I finally got around to buying another bottle of NCF to do a proper review. The following is my experience with the Aberlour 12, 16, A'bunadh #40, and the amazing 12 NCF.\\n\\n\\n\\nReviews not done in one sitting. Left to rest for ~15-20 minutes before nosing or tasting. All taken neat except the A'bunadh.\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Double Cask Matured 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep Amber.\\n* **Nose:** Sherry, fruit--apple, hint of orange peel.\\n* **Taste:** Heavy Honey. Fruits, pears, apples and then fades (or is it overtaken?) into a peppery spice.\\n* **Finish:** Nothing too crazy. Medium Length. Sugary apples fading out to leave a huge pepper taste. Not a great finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe regular 12yr blew me away when I first had it. Now that I have had some time to really find my palate it doesn't seem *as* compelling. It is still a great dram for the price, and I will likely always stock it. But it isn't balanced too well -- especially in the finish.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 16yr 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Add some ruby to the 12yr.\\n* **Nose:** *Very* similar to the 12yr. Seems like it has picked up some more vanilla or toffee notes though.\\n* **Taste:** Very smooth. The pepper has lost its overpowering kick here. The woody/oaky elements come out more with the extra aging. Hints of that vanilla like a bourbon.\\n* **Finish:** Just a better finish than the 12yr. More robust sherry with the vanilla that steps aside slowly for the pepper to creep in to leave a warm longer finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent example of how a scotch can benefit from more time in the cask. It basically just took all the rough edges of that 12yr and smoothed them out to just build a better whisky from the same excellent foundation.\\n\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #40 60% w/water**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep deep red amber.\\n* **Nose:** The high ABV gave me some trouble here. I got big sherry notes (obviously). Oranges. Earthy/woody notes.\\n* **Taste:** It is almost as if someone took a dried fruit medley (prunes, dates, raisins etc) and just removed most of the sugar. You get huge fruity notes without the overpowering sweetness that would come along with it. Nutty flavors slide in and out. A peppery finish lingers behind all of this.\\n* **Finish:** Very long and warm. Transitions nicely from the complex fruit flavors into that warm hazelnut pepper. And then right when you think its going to fade you get the oaky flavors coming back.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had to drink this a few times and experiment with the water to figure out how to really enjoy this one. Drinking it neat is just murder on your taste buds and nose. Too much water and you lose too much character and its bores you. Once I found the sweet spot it became one of my favorites. I just wish I could try more batches (maybe that infamous #38).\\n\\n**92/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Non Chill-Filtered 48% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** In my dim light a nice red honey.\\n* **Nose:** Powerful sherry, raisins, dark chocolate.\\n* **Taste:** All the fruit. Seriously. Sherry with a hint of citrus. Raisins, fresh cherry, dates, prunes? There is definitely a nutty element here as well. Possible almond or hazelnut. It is fairly sweet with a touch of honey. \\n* **Finish:** This finish is solid. It isn't crazy long but it is exceptionally balanced. The fruits fade slowly to reveal a lingering sherry and spice and balance perfectly. The higher ABV keeps you warm throughout.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the winner of the lineup. The flavors might not be as pronounced as the A'bunadh but they just play off each other so much better. It is slightly more expensive than the normal 12yr which makes it an easy buy for the exceptional craft you get. I have a hard time believing this is the same 12yr just not filtered. If that is truly the case I am appalled they would tarnish so much scotch in the name of filtration. I am really disappointed this is [allegedly] being discontinued.\\n\\n**96/100**\",\n",

Adding water leads to notes of honey, hazelnuts and pralines.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Barley malt, sugar cookies, raisins, spices—nutmeg, vanilla, cloves. The addition of water reveals notes of honey and green apple, and lessens the raisin/grape notes.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Hazelnuts, malt, grape must. It’s not a long finish and water doesn’t change it.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I don’t love the colour scheme, but it’s designed to make it stand out on a back bar or shelf, what with the powder blue label.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  It’s a decent beginner’s malt or simple dram to enjoy on ice in the summer. Not really my bag, but not bad. I prefer the 12-year-old. The brand rep mentioned that some of the flavours in this indicate that it must be 7.5 years of age on average, but… yeah. I’d take that with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\\n**72/100**.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**The Glenlivet 15 – French Oak Reserve** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 40% ABV, 15 Years Old*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $88  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +1  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Spice melange, oak, orange oil, resin, thyme, maple syrup, plenty of rich, sweet fruitiness as well.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Very nice mouthfeel, soft and sweet with spiced honey, hazelnuts, pralines, orange oil, toffee & some strong oak tannins and influence.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sweet, spiced honey, hazelnuts, cedar, resin, caramel, and oak. Medium length, quite pleasant.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I’ll be honest enough to say I don’t love the packaging of The Glenlivet lineup. This one isn’t bad, but it doesn’t strike my fancy either.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Much more to my palate than the 1824 Founders Reserve. Excellent winter dram if you’re not craving smokiness or peat influence.  \\n\\n\\n**81/100**.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**The Glenlivet 18 (re-review)** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 43% ABV, 18 Years Old*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $150  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +2  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Oloroso sherry influence makes itself immediately known—nuttiness, syrupiness, oak-derived smokiness, warming spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and walnuts.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Nutty, thick mouthfeel, slight smokiness from the oak, plenty of tannins and spice. The honey from the younger entrants in the lineup has matured into something more like toffee or molasses.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Smoke, oak, nutmeg, raisins, spices intermingle with wood influence. It’s long, it’s pleasant, it’s warming. Great for cold weather.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is where their packaging starts to look a bit more appealing to me. Maybe that’s just because I know there’s quality whisky within.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  A more serious and challenging version of the 15. I’m not sure if the full-sized bottle just tastes better, but this one scores higher than the sample-sized bottle I tried a year ago. Maybe it’s had more time to breathe.  \\n\\n\\n**85/100**.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**The Glenlivet Nadurra First Fill Selection** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 60.4% ABV, NCF, NAS*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $103  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -3  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Sweet, unctuous, green apple, spiced honey, lemon, plenty of ethanol.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Sour apple, sweet honey, heather, white pepper, cedar sawdust, vanilla, lime.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Honey, white pepper, apple, bourbon cask influence exerts itself with a smoke/honey flavour and vanilla. Long finish.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  Definitely seems like natural colour. I quite like the Nadurra label actually.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Lovely stuff! Great summer dram. It’s wonderful that they bottle this stuff at such a high strength, seeing as they don’t sell much to independent bottlers.

This reminds me of a souped-up Chivas.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  It’s a wee squat li’l bottle with a large cork. I don’t love it. I feel like I’m being overly harsh on packaging today.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Lovely malt and a wonderful intro to ex-sherry/European oak cask influence. Oddly chocolatey. Reminds me of Chivas Regal, but minus the … blendy bits. I do like it.  (This is actually the second time I’ve had this whisky, each of which were at tastings or events.

Smoke, chocolate, salted caramel, sweet green tea/matcha, oak tannins and resin.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sweet caramel, smoke, chocolate, spices, oak fibres, fresh ream of printer paper, sawdust.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I like the labels from batch 20-30 more.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Wonderful stuff, plenty of cask influence, though I get more red wine than sherry.

Grape must, stems, vegetal and earthy. Plastic bucket, oak tannins and spices, sawdust and honey. Very strange.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Honey, oak tannins, spice, grape stems and pomace brandy. Floral notes of lavender and heather appear after a while as well. Medium length.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I like the boat, I don’t mind the label, the box is quite pretty. I like it.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  A middle-of-the-road mouthfeel, but very interesting flavour. Very Pernod Ricard/Chivas. Fits their house style well, but different enough to stand out from the rest of their lineup. Pomace notes are lovely, and somehow work with the plastic-y/bucket-y flavours. Opens up and gets very sweet with time, with some of the vegetal notes dying down after a while. I like it.  \\n\\n\\n**84/100**.',\n",

       " 'I didn’t try this one but had a bottle of the NCF 12yo and that one also wasn’t great. I lost all hope for Aberlour. Not only their whiskies are nothing to write home about, I also had a bad experience at their distillery when we arrived about half an hour before they were closing and they didn’t let us inside the shop because other people were there (COVID restrictions) and after that they were closing. We wasted an hour to get there. Compare that to Tomatin distillery which was closed but when I called and said I only wanted to go to the shop and buy something they opened for us and were happy to chat about their whisky. Just goes to show who cares more about your custom.',\n",
       " '**Aberlour 12, 40% ABV**\\n\\nAberlour represents, for me, one of the better bang-for-buck opportunities out there for when I’m wanting a scotch aged in sherry casks.  Their standard 12 is decent enough to my palate, and is, I think, a definite notch above the typical supermarket bottles like the Glenfiddich 12 or the Glenlivet 12 despite being comparatively priced.  Its closest competitor in terms of an entry-level sherrybomb is the Macallan 12, and it costs five bucks less here while being, I think, better overall.  Meanwhile, the non-chill filtered 12 is an entirely different beast, and it represents, on balance, a real step up from the standard (and presumably chill filtered) 12 that is quite worth its higher price tag—and since price point is a component of all my reviews, that element will be included here as well.\\n\\n**Nose**: Figs, strawberries, and marmalade all burst out at first, undoubtedly because of Aberlour’s sherry sherryness, but beneath are surprising notes of cream and vanilla extract.  High tea, anyone?\\n\\n**Body**: A tad thin, and much thinner than the 12 NCF, but still with a reasonable enough heft and weight that it isn’t out of character as an Aberlour.  Perhaps a slight negative, but not an overly detrimental one.\\n\\n**Palate**: Plenty of fruit, especially grapes and cherries, are present, but in a fruit tart sort of taste, since there are hints of spice flavors as well, like nutmeg, cinnamon, or even gingersnap.\\n\\n**Finish**: The creaminess from the nose makes an encore appearance, along with some leafier botanical notes as the finish tapers out into a medium linger.  Not terribly complex, but enjoyable just the same.\\n\\n**Price**: USD $37 at my local liquor store.  Worth every penny if you’re in the market for an entry-level sherrybomb, or you want a daily drinker with more character than the big supermarket brands.\\n\\n**Overall**: This isn’t a bad whisky by any means, but it’s sort of the Laphroaig 10 of sherried whiskies, by which I mean it’s a young expression that hits you hard with its main flavor.  But unlike similar products from larger distilleries, Aberlour 12 at least tries to offer a trifle of depth, whereas its competitors are largely one-trick ponies.  For this, it gets a more favorable final tally than it otherwise would have.  83/100\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 non-chill filtered, 48% ABV**\\n\\nThe 12 NCF does not appear on the core range of whiskies on their website, at least not anymore, which makes me worried that Aberlour may have discontinued it--can anyone smarter or more connected than I confirm whether it has been?  Google searches have yielded no definitive results.  It would be a damn shame if production on it has been discontinued, because it is a mighty fine dram.\\n\\n**Nose**: Grapes, dates, and figs leap out first from the sherry—this is Aberlour, after all—and some grain or wheat beneath it, like you’re munching on toast with jam for breakfast, except way better.\\n\\n**Body**: A lot of depth and texture, which, on top of the lack of chill filtration, the higher ABV compared to the standard 12 probably helps with.  Syrupy, but not too overly so—simply full and rounded in feel.  Very enjoyable.\\n\\n**Palate**: The jam and sherry from the nose continues, but are joined by flavors of molasses, maple, blackberries, strawberries, and plums.  It’s not enough to simply call it “fruity;” I could detect a lot of different individual fruit flavors, and they interacted together quite pleasantly and with seemingly little effort.  I’m reviewing this in September, but really, it’d be soooooo on point during the winter.\\n\\n**Finish**: Smooth with a slight burn, decidedly above average for a 12 year old scotch.  Lingers a decent length and tapers out into a final burst of jammy sweetness at the very end, which was a rather satisfying note to end the dram on.  Let this be a lesson: chill filtration makes scotch worse.\\n\\n**Price**: USD $55 in my neighborhood and roughly the same online, which I think is an entirely reasonable price point for the quality and depth of what you’re getting.  The standard 12 is, like I said, in the $35-40 neighborhood and represents a decent bang-for-buck buy in its own right, but really, these are two different whiskies and are priced accordingly.\\n\\n**Overall**: This is, like the Old Pulteney 12, one of the best exhibits of evidence that age isn’t the be-all, end-all with scotch, and that you can still get an excellent whisky without shelling out for the increasingly pricey 15-21 year old expressions.  The layers of depth in the palate and the smoothness of the finish speak to the quality that electing to not chill filter can impart, and makes it a decidedly superior product to the standard 12.  Definitely not a scotch for those of you who don’t care for the sherry-crazed potions that Aberlour concocts, but otherwise, definitely worth a go.  89/100',\n",

Following that [community review](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1fs6yp/community_review_19_caol_ila_12/cadc6sk), I\\'m stepping away from my brief 2oz journey into Isaly territory, *back* into sherried whisky; this time of the Speyside persuasion . . . \\n\\n__________________________________________________________\\n**Aberlour 12, Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky**; matured for 12 years in traditional and sherry oak casks; 43% abv; $46.99 for a 750 mL bottle; enjoyed a neat [dram](http://i.imgur.com/8gbZRJ4h.jpg)\\n___________________________________________________________\\n\\n**Atmosphere:** No music this time.

Fruits and spices abound. Fresh red apples, a big waft of medicinal edge, crushed red pepper, cinnamon, roses in full bloom, Dubble Bubble bubble gum, an acidic walk through an orange grove (Floridian here . . .). Water intesifies the fruitiness and dilutes the alcoholic edge. \\n\\n**Tasting:** A massive spicy kick. Christmas spices, nutmeg, cinnamon and pine needles (like gin). Bananas, toffee, chocolate, more fresh crunchy apples, bitter cocoa, stale cereal, and an ever present metallic coating. \\n\\n**Finish:** Warm and lingering. That metallic edge remains but eventually gives way to a nice fruity and sweet finish. \\n\\nScore: **78/100**\\n\\nBeing one of the Beginner\\'s Recommendations and a highly reviewed bottle of scotch across many users here and many blogs at large, I came into this dram with high hopes. For the most part, it\\'s great, because it has a lot of variety going for it. Truly, the best thing I can say about Aberlour 12 is it\\'s a whisky not afraid to command your attention. With all of the spices, it was like the drink was yanking me by the neck, saying, \"Now look here!\" \"I won\\'t be ignored,\" or other such nonsense that obviously doesn\\'t come from inanimate objects. \\n\\nFor Aberlour\\'s part, some of the sweeter moments were fantastic. The fresh red apples, the cinnamon, the sometimes hot crushed red pepper rush it gave me were all well balanced and welcomed to my palate; the problem is that they\\'re ruined by a medicinal and metallic edge that just isn\\'t welcome. An Islay is one thing, but with this largely fruity speyside, the chemical cringe it gave me was too often and too unwelcome. \\n\\nI\\'ve spent some time with this whisky--this isn\\'t a first impression anymore--and while I understand people\\'s appreciation of its flavor, I can\\'t understand people\\'s outright admonition. Aberlour 12 is confident and audacious, but it\\'s got some scars, warts, and blemishes that I think some whisky connoisseurs are too quick to ignore. \\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention...although I really wasn\\'t a fan of the tasting overall, the nose was absolutely gorgeous.

       " '**43% ABV**\\n\\n* **Nose:** Sweet dried fruits on the nose, figs, raisins and sultanas.  Mild clove with unripe cherries.   To me it seems there are decent sherry casks at work here. From the standard oak casks I only get a hint of pear and cooked apples.  A pleasant nose, but not fantastic.\\n\\n* **Taste:** The sherry casks all but disappear, and the oak casks take front stage.  Ever so slightly \" spirity \", even though it is bottled at a relatively low 43% ABV.  A mishmash of both cask characteristics; very slight notes of the usual sherry cask raisin and chocolate flavors, and more dominate notes of vanilla and honey.  No particular flavor steals the show, and not many others stand out as well.  Somewhat disappointing.  Only barley and oak seem to make any lasting appearance.\\n\\n* **Finish:** The finish is a tad dry and barley infused and rather uneventful.  A quick flash of that sherry cask sweetness appears, but is just as quickly gone.\\n\\nI can\\'t help but think this whisky was matured in the sherry casks for too short a time.  They seem like decent casks, especially in the nose, perhaps the time given to the sherry cask maturation needs to be longer to help bring out that luscious sweetness throughout a little more. It certainly isn\\'t sherry rich like A\\'Bunadh nor is it meant to be.

       " \"**Review #15: Aberlour 12 Year Old Double Cask**\\n\\nAberlour is a Speyside distillery located in Aberlour, Strathspey, Scotland on the banks of the Rivers Spey and Lour. It was founded by James Fleming, son of a local tenant farmer, in 1879 after having worked at Dailuiane distillery for ten years. Over time Aberlour became a very popular affordable single malt distiller, under the ownership of Chivas Brothers, and have become well known for their 12 year offering and especially for their A'Bunadh cask strength bottling.\\n\\nThe 12 Year Old is matured in 2 types of casks, traditional oak and seasoned sherry butts. I bought this at the LCBO on sale for $60 CAD. It sits at 40% ABV so it is chill filtered.\\n\\n* Color: Dark gold\\n* Nose: Oak, dried fruits, strawberry, cherry, cinnamon, raisins, ginger\\n* Taste: Dried fruits, apricot, cherry pie, light spicy cinnamon, nutmeg, light vanilla\\n* Finish: Short-medium with baking spiced and toasty raisins \\n\\nOverall this is definitely one of the better single malts I've had for the price. While not as imposing and complex as the A'Bunadh it is still quite tasty for the price and surprisingly felt very full bodied for a 40% whisky. While I wouldn't buy a bottle of this again because it doesn't really have a strong enough spice flavor in it and the flavor palate was quite simple and not overly colorful. Still it’s a decent dram and is great for a fall drink, but it just doesn't hold up enough to be something worth a second look.\\n\\n**Final Score: 79/100**\\n\\nNote: Please excuse the title this is actually review #15.\",\n",

       " \"For a few years now, I would have called myself a “Rum drinker”, but that probably wasn’t totally accurate. I liked a few decent rums, and I could stand them neat. Recently I started trying other types of alcohol, and absolutely fell in love with Scotch. In my explorations I eventually stumbled across sherry Scotch (not all that hard to do really). Needless to say from the review pool, I am now a huge fan of Sherry Cask Scotches. I have a large “to get” list, and many of my purchases (and my future reviews) moving forward are going to involve broadening my selection and trying styles I have only had once or never at all. I feel I have reached a point now where my reviews may actually mean something, so here we go!\\n\\n\\n**Tasting Method:** .5 oz at a time, and 2.5oz total for each review. I revisited it across 5 nights to get the best perspective that wasn't tainted from one day.\\n\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**Dalwhinnie 15 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Highland, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Green apples at the forefront with charcoal on the edge of the smell. Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.\\n\\n**Taste:** This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice. \\n\\n**Finish:** Both sour and sweet elements carry over, hanging onto a bit of the charcoal note as well. The floral notes in the nose come back here at the end of the taste, but I can’t put my finger on any particular flower names….it is just floral. A decent yet light mouth feel. The flavor lingers for 1-2 minutes.\\n\\n**Rating:** 84/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I’ve had my ups and downs with this Scotch. Overall it’s a pretty low key and is trying to be as inoffensive as possible. It’s very simple, its major elements are sweet, and it doesn’t really leave a characteristically defining impact on me. This is what I imagine an “okay” lowland would taste like, which is one style I have yet to actually try. Out of everything I currently have, this is where I would start someone new to Scotch tasting.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 10 Year Fine Oak**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 40%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Overall a light nose, with white grapes and green apples being the primary elements. Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived. \\n\\n**Finish:** Aftertaste is rich but un-abrasive, with vanilla, mild spiced cinnamon (certainly of sherry origin) and a background of oak. It is a pronounced aftertaste, but lingers for only about 1-2 minutes. Very little mouth feel, but there is some. \\n\\n**Rating:** 88/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is nice, if a bit simple. I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background. \\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 12 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Grapes and apples to about equal degrees, with maybe a touch of cherry. A spiciness that wraps itself nicely into the initial fruit aroma, with a lingering oak background. It’s nice, not too overwhelming but certainly appetizing. \\n\\n**Taste:** Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. \\n\\n**Finish:** The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes. This has a good mouth feel that isn’t too intense, but is intense enough to make itself known on the tongue. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a good 2-3 minutes, certainly satisfying. \\n\\n**Rating:** 91/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I really like this Scotch, it’s not trying to be the most complex or intricate masterpiece but it is amazingly solid at what it is trying to do and embraces what it brings to the table. It is refined enough to sit and analyze, but casual enough to be a daily drinker. Out of all my Sherry Scotches, if I HAD to pick one to keep around as an “affordable” drinker it would be this (let’s hope it never comes to that)!\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 18 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet fruits galore, a bit hard to peg down but cherry, apples, grapes and some berry I can’t put my finger on. The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. \\n\\n**Taste:** Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.\\n\\n**Finish:** The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste. The mouth feel is much more prevalent and hot on the tongue, and without a decent enough amount of time could very quickly numb it. The flavor lingers for easily 3-4 minutes plus.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is really spectacular and exactly what I was expecting out of a “high end” Scotch. Complexity that leaves me entirely fulfilled while keeping every element of said complexity in the aftertaste to be enjoyed for as long as possible. This stuff is pretty expensive and is not something I would ever drink daily, but boy do I wish I could.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan Cask Strength**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 58.4%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** A very vibrant and rich aroma with elements of caramel, spice, hot cinnamon, sweet grapes, red apples, and cherry. Very powerful, and a few good whiffs leave a mild sting/numbness in the nose which is really great.\\n\\n**Taste:** A bit of toffee right before a hot cinnamon and spice blast, intense but not overboard. It doesn’t take long for the most intense part to pass, where afterwards come in caramel, a myriad of different apples but mainly red, sweet grapes, a bit of cherry, a tinge of bitter on the tongue. All the flavors are very deep, and I wouldn’t say one of them takes the “background” roll. All very upfront and in your face.\\n\\n**Finish:** Hot spice lingers on the tongue, with a nice oak note coming through now. Along with it are cinnamon and apples ringing on the tongue, a very vibrant and deep mouth feel. The taste lingers for 3-4 minutes plus. A bit of numbing of the tongue which I love.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** Wow, this is superb! I don’t think it’s as evolving in taste as the 18, but all of its flavors are much more powerful and rich. I really enjoy Macallan for their focus on hot spice notes, and boy does this have it in force. I hunted down the last two bottles I could find locally, and I’m glad I did. I can only hope it comes back into production sometime. This along with the A’bunadh make me wish more distilleries would consistently release cask strength batches. \",\n",

I hit a few fruits and slight sherry and then a brick wall of medicinal alcoholic vapor. The palate was anti-climactic, watery to light oily, hot and sour and peppery, into a finish of the same apple, pepper, citrus that trails off into a weak toffee flavor.\\n\\nI still have half my sample so I'm going to see if adding some water benefits this in anyway for me.\\n\\nTo be completely honest I enjoy Cutty Sark, Dewars 12 and Johnnie Black over this double cask Aberlour. I do appreciate trying a sample of this though. I can't imagine why they wouldn't put more spirit towards the Aberlour 12 NCF line instead of this one, I haven't had the NCF but I hear great things.

       " '**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured** - Review #7\\n\\n\\n* **Info:** Received as a wedding gift, 43% abv\\n\\n* **Color:** amber +1, slightest orange tinge\\n\\n* **Nose:** Initially I get spices and sweetness, cinnamon sugar (like a candied almond), coriander, muted sherry, orange syrup, apple sauce.  Some of this nose reminds of a young bourbon with light corn and faint toasted wood.  A very dessert like nose.  However, not the \"smoothest\" nose I\\'ve smelled.  A definate prickliness persists even\\n\\t\\tthough this isn\\'t a cask strength whisky.  With water it turns a little fresher and fruitier.\\n\\n* **Palate:** The immediate impression is general sweetness but it turns surprisingly dry and tannic right after.  Gentle suggestions of sherry and fruit with a malty backbone. Perhaps some apricot or peach notes.  However, behind everything else this comes across as a little bit boozy.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Shortish but not too bad. Heavy wood spices which fade after a minute with a more gentle tannic raisin flavor remaining, slightly over brewed tea.\\n\\n* **Conclusions:** This carries the standard profile I\\'ve come to know of the double matured Speysider.  The sherry double maturation here serves mostly to add a lot of European oak spice flavors and darkens the fruit flavors a touch.\\n\\t\\tAdditionally, there are a few rough edges in both the nose and the palate that could probably have been fixed by a few more years in the cask.  It is definitely enjoyable and the powerful spiciness helps to combat the sweetness.\\n\\t\\tOverall, a good whisky, but not terribly distinct or unique.  I long to try some of the older Aberlours and hope to get a bottle of the 16 sometime soon.\\n\\n**78/100**\\n',\n",
       " 'Back to Speyside! Saw this at the liquor store and knew it would be in my wheels house with a nice balance of bourbon and sherry influence. This was a really nice whisky that I would easily go back to. \\n\\nOn the nose, this is a very expressive scotch with plenty of speyside character. I primarily get caramel, raisins, vanilla, a touch of apricot, and just a bit of clove. There’s a fair bit of sherry here as well, and it comes over really nicely and is well balanced between sweetness, fruit, and spice. \\n\\nOn the palate, the complexity isn’t quite as vast, and transforms to become more of a spicy baked apple, candied orange, and apricot ordeal, with some grassiness and oak in back. Great flavours overall. \\n\\nThe finish is fairly sweet still, and retains some of those nice flavours, particularly after the bottle has been open for a while. It really conjures Christmas pudding in a lot of ways. \\n\\nOverall a great whiskey, and a big pull for me towards Spey. I enjoy the complexity in this scotch for something non-prayed, and the finish is actually quite good in comparison to a lot of other similar scotch varieties. A new favorite for me. 82/100.',\n",

Almost non-existent. Give it some time, cover it up and you have the mixture between the two casks coming together to make a cake like smell.\\n\\nIn this case, the cake is in fact a lie (I\\'ll show myself out.... unless you\\'ll believe that I\\'m jet lagged and that\\'s where that old nugget came from).\\n\\n**Taste:** Lemon, smoke, oak, vanilla, orange liqueur, cumin, cherry\\n\\nRight amount of fruit, oak, and spice. Good balance, though a bit limited. Kept looking for Godot in the taste.\\n\\n**Finish:** Strawberry, cherry pepper, mushrooms, peppercorns, dill\\n\\nSimple, medium short finish with heat and earth. The dill surprised me, which is nice, not that there isn\\'t anything wrong with that. I\\'m just saying it isn\\'t for me.\\n\\nWell there\\'s my required three cultural references, guess I can conclude\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is a good start on a whisky. I\\'m actually finding myself a little confused though. It\\'s almost like it needed more time in each Cask to pump up the flavours. Very subtle, albeit weak flavours, and I wish they had gone to a 14 year with it to really see how it would grow. Or maybe make a new A\\'bunadh version using this technique.\\n\\nGranted I\\'ve only ever aged 750ml of rum, so maybe I\\'m full of shit. Just maybe.\\n\\n**81/100**\\n\\n*Past Aberlour Reviews:*\\n\\n* [Aberlour Sherry Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1bnrse/aberlour_12_sherry_cask_review/)\\n\\n* [Aberlour 10 year](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/15y8al/aberlour_10_review/)\\n\\n\\n*Scotch review #71, Speyside review #20*',\n",

Boy was that not necessary.  The color of the two is nearly identical (I suspect caramel coloring. I held the bottles up to the light to see how much more cloudy the Non Chill Filtered version would be, but both are nearly identical in that regard as well.  The \"legs\" on the Non Chill Filtered version take FOREVER to develop compared to the Double Cask Matured, thanks to the 5% higher ABV (honestly I\\'ve had a habit of checking out the legs on my whisky just for the hell of it, but never compared two side by side like this before, the difference was pretty damned cool).

The nose is assertive, while the nose on the Double Cask Matured is much softer.  The mouthfeel is awesome I assume due to both the higher ABV and lack of Chill Filtration.  The slightly sour notes on the nose and taste of the Double Cask Matured have gone away (I’m not a big fan of the sour notes, but quite frankly I don’t recall them being that strong before, perhaps it’s just in the comparison they really jump out, or oxidation due to it being the end of the bottle and it having sat around for a few weeks?)  The Finish on the Non Chill Filtered seems to cling and not want to let go, it’s awesome.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would have included the A’Bunadh in the shootout, but only have 2 glencairns :).\\n',\n",

Seriously, it's a fantastic opportunity for all 12k Malt Meisters.\\n\\n*Color:* Deep Copper (possibly finished in sherry or port casks?)\\n\\n*Nose:* A little tinge of alcohol. It doesn’t overwhelm. Oily citrus, sweet cream, cinnamon, toasted malt, honey with stewed red fruits and raisins, smooth and nutty. A touch of sweet tobacco?\\n\\n*Taste:* Medium-full bodied. More sweet red fruits (Distinct sherry flavor profile). Nicely spiced. White pepper perfectly counterbalanced with honey. Oak and vanilla. More sweet cream with oily citrus (ripe orange rind). There’s a nice freshness to this dram, like homemade lemonade. A slight touch of mint.\\n\\n*Finish:* Definitely a higher proof. Big, warm, spiced and sweet. The sweet, red fruits really shine with a touch of tart (strawberry jam). Long finish. The spice really lingers on the tip of your tongue.\\n\\n*Overall:* This is a wonderful dram. The nose is so clean, I was originally thinking it was an 80 proof whisky. It’s very nicely balanced and a dream of a Speyside. After a full dram, I would definitely say it’s a cask strength, finished in sherry casks, most likely a Speyside, and is wonderfully complex, yet perfectly balanced. If I had to guess, I would say the color and flavor are in line with Aberlour A’bunadh. As a big Speyside fan, this is on par with the Macallan CS for my ideal dessert dram.\\n\\n\\n**Total:** 94/100\\n\\nThanks again to BigPapi for the wonderful mystery dram!

I felt like a sherried whisky today, so I went with a perennial favourite of Scotchit: *Aberlour 12 NCF*. \\n\\nApparently this is still double matured like the regular 12 Double Cask, though I was lead to believe that it was matured exclusively in sherry casks. Regardless, /u/texacer loves it, will I?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered**  \\n*Speyside, 48% ABV, NCF, no E150?, €37.50/700ml* \\n\\n**Nose**: Rich Oloroso sherry. Strawberries. Spicy cloves and cinnamon. Caramel and red apples. Plums and raisins. *Later:* Brown sugar and syrup. Canned peaches and a hint of malt. *With water:* Less spices, more red apple.\\n\\nVery sherried, no doubt about it. It's very spicy, as well, with lots of dark spices and dark fruits. It's a pretty damn good sherried nose, but clearly more Oloroso than PX, where I think the GlenDronach CS I have leans more towards PX sweetness. Over time, it sweetens and becomes fruitier. Water sweetens it even more, muting the spices and bringing out more red apples.\\n\\n**Taste**: Full bodied. Immediate alcohol bite. Spicy cinnamon and nutmeg. Lots of Oloroso sherry. White pepper. Raisins and sultanas. Mildly bitter toasted oak tannins. *Later:* Raspberries and peaches. *With water:* Strawberries! Less spices. Worse mouthfeel. =(\\n\\nSpicy, and not quite as sweet as the nose would suggest. Big, big bruiser of a whisky, with peppery notes and a hint of bitterness in the background, but not enough to really bother me. Over time, some of that bitterness and spiciness dies down and gives way to more fruity notes. Water kills the spices almost entirely and brings the fruits to the foreground, especially strawberries. Kind of kills the mouthfeel though.\\n\\n**Finish**: A bit short. Sherry, obviously. Mild oaky bitterness. Cardamom and cinnamon. Sultanas. White pepper. Slight berries (blackcurrant?).\\n\\nActually surprisingly short finish, can't claim I'm not a little disappointed by it. It's pretty good, though, and warms your throat instead of burning your tongue, which is nice for a change since I've been drinking a large amount of younger whiskies lately. \\n\\n**Summary**: Sherry! Lots of sherry. It's nice, I can't really fault that. It's also a tad too spicy in my opinion - I'd appreciate more fruits without having to water it down and ruin the mouthfeel. I'd say this is on par with a rye whiskey, where more standard sherried Scotches tend to be like bourbon. This is more aggressive, spicier and with less sweetness. \\n\\nThat said, it is good, and water smooths it out quite a bit. And for the price, this is an excellent dram (+1 points). I may have put a tad too much water in this, because it tends to be the last thing I do, which messes up the proportions. It's something I'll experiment with in the future, adding just individual drops of water. I should get a pipette.

Unlike DC, the malt notes aren’t dominant here, and that makes for a more interesting experience. With a little air, the NCF is still quite drinkable, which is somewhat surprising. So it actually fits into that band of wanting something tasty to drink without requiring a lot of attention. \\n* **DC - Score:** **78/100** \\n* **NCF - Score:** **83/100**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nScoring legend:\\n\\n* 96-100: Amazing – I’ve had nothing better in the category\\n* 90-95: Excellent – One of my all-time favorites\\n* 85-89: Great – Well above average and very enjoyable\\n* 80-84: Good – Quite enjoyable\\n* 70-79: Around average – Drinkable to somewhat tasty\\n* 60-69: Flawed to Below-average – Still drinkable, but not enjoyable\\n* Under 59: No Bueno – From mixers down\",\n",

       " 'Good day to all you sexy scotch sippers. I am very pleased to finally share my thoughts on this whisky I’ve been trying to get my hands on for several months now. I was perusing my local Total Wine and saw the last one of these babies sitting on the shelf. After letting out an audible “fuck yea” I snatched it up and thoroughly embarrassed myself in front of a couple glaring shoppers (I’m sure they were just jealous though). Alright, enough of that. Let’s get to it.\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Year Non Chill-Filtered, 48% ABV, $55**\\n\\n**Color:** Deep Amber, It almost warms you up by just looking at it\\n\\n**Nose:** One of the most complex noses I’ve ever encountered. Cherry, honeydew, sweet sherry, brown sugar/molasses, vanilla caramel, candied gala apples, walnuts, orange rind, a tad floral. Good lord, this nose kept evolving for a good 15 minutes. \\n\\n**Taste:** “Pow, right in the kisser.” Cherries and apples baked with cinnamon, creamy vanilla, plums, cocoa, walnuts. Very creamy mouthfeel. The taste matches the complexity of the nose. Unbelievable.\\n\\n**Finish:** Throat coating, mouth tingling, warm and spicy goodness. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Wow. This one was well worth the wait. From nose to finish this one is truly an adventure, I would have never guessed that a speyside could embody so much complexity and boldness. The lack of chill-filtration does wonders for this one; I’ve never tried the original 12 year but I’m guessing it is not nearly as amazing. I know that the availability of the NCF is scarce at the moment but if you can get your hands on it, you will not be disappointed (especially at $55!). \\n\\n**95/100**\\n\\n*Sidenote:* Smelling the glass after drinking, I pick up a beautiful aroma of brown sugar and mocha. \\n\\n*Sidenote sidenote:* I would love to see how this one compares to the A’bunadh and the Macallan CS, has anyone had the pleasure of tasting all three?\\n',\n",
       " '**Aberlour 12 NCF**\\n\\nAberlour is a Speyside distillery with a reputation for heavily sherried Scotch - this is their 12 year, non chill-filtered (not to be confused with their double cask) version. [Ralfy discusses chill filtration here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoaabEFrUD4). Thanks to /u/dmsn7d for the sample. 48% abv.\\n\\n**Nose** - Very nice, bold sherry notes. Raisins, red grapes, low % dark chocolate, cinnamon, clove, allspice, honey, maybe some vanilla. Really nicely balanced.\\n\\n**Taste** - Very easygoing entry. Honey, raisin, vanilla, allspice, with a bit of a drying coffee note and some black pepper coming in as it develops. Thick, rich texture - the lack of chill filtration is really felt here, in a good way. Flavors play well off each other here.\\n\\n**Finish** - Black pepper is prominent, with dark chocolate, clove, red grapes, vanilla, and raisin. Nice long finish, that sticks with you a bit. Gets a bit of an astringent coffee-ish note here, though.\\n\\nThis is some very nice stuff - the flavors are bold and very well balanced, with a lot of weight to them. Outstanding value, as well (value does not factor in to my score). This whisky really makes you wish there weren’t so many whiskies that had been neutered via chill filtration. Gotta make those uneducated consumers happy though, I guess - at least there’s stuff like this out there though, even if it’s mostly IB’s.\\n\\n**89**/100\\n_____________________________________________________\\n**Glendronach 12**\\n\\nGlendronach is a Highland distillery, owned by Billy Walker’s group, along with Glenglassaugh and Benriach. Since his takeover, they’ve been arguably the best producer of sherried Scotch running. This is their entry level version, matured in PX and Oloroso Sherry casks. 43% abv. Thanks again to /u/dmsn7d for the sample.\\n\\n**Nose** - Thick, rich, sherried nose. Seems more mature than the age statement indicates, though I don’t think this is padded with extra aged whisky they way the 15 year is (but who really knows). Raisins, Mexican chocolate, vanilla, clove, gingerbread cookies, tart cherries, black pepper, allspice.\\n\\n**Taste** - Still rich and sherried - a bit more bitter/earthy than the nose made me think. Coffee, fruitcake, raisins, Mexican chocolate, cherries, with peppery spice coming in as it develops. Medium-light body, a bit watery.\\n\\n**Finish** - Coffee, black pepper, clove, cherry, Mexican chocolate. Fairly short. The coffee note doesn’t quite sit well with the others here.\\n\\nThis is a good example of an entry-level sherried Scotch, that doesn’t take any shortcuts. Nicely full flavored, with big sherry notes, though the finish is a bit short and the coffee note I get isn’t completely welcome, but it’s still solid.\\n\\n**85**/100\\n',\n",
       " 'Good evening, friends!  Here are my notes for my first go at a modest vertical review.  These two big sherried offerings from Aberlour are quite beloved of the larger community of malt-heads out there, and justifiably so, as I\\'ve come to find out.  I also thought it would be educational (and, you know, delicious) to try a few whiskies of very similar profiles to see whether the differences between them might be thrown into relief.  Gonna change up my review style a touch, too.  On to the whisky!\\n\\n\\n\\n**Aberlour \"A\\'bunadh\" Single Malt, batch 32 (60.4% abv), non chill-filtered**\\n\\n\\n* **Color:** pretty\\n\\n* **On the nose:** right away you\\'re swimming in rich milk chocolate, oranges, and I suppose chocolate oranges?  Cherries make me think of Black Forest cherry cake, and then there\\'re sugared hazelnuts, Nutella, ginger, nutmeg, and maybe a whiff of cardamom?  Maybe I\\'m getting ahead of myself.  Definitely figs, buttery sugary cookies, and toffee.  With a teaspoon or two of water there\\'s more brown sugar, syrup/molasses... maybe root beer?  Some of the fruit becomes like a tawny port, with golden raisins aplenty.\\n\\n\\n* **Taste and Finish:** here are all of these sweet dried fruits and zingy baking spices... pow!  There\\'s a pleasant and just slightly bitter nuttiness, and something rummy... sugarcane?  Nice creamy cappuccino notes too.  Dense, dessert-y as expected, and pretty indulgent.  Finish is long and powerful (thanks, high proof!) and alternates dried fruit and nuttiness.  Trying to compare my recent memory of the Macallan CS with this, I\\'d say I recall a touch more of the butter and dry spice in the Mac, and maybe a teensy bit more dried fruit in the A\\'bunadh?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m a big fan of this A\\'bunadh.  I\\'m glad it\\'s readily available and generally not too awfully pricey.  In my own personal preference, I think I slightly prefer the buttery spice of the Macallan over this, but that\\'s really splitting small subjective hairs between two lovely whiskies.  Would I buy a bottle?  Sure.  I have a lot of great sherried whisky vying for my attention for the moment, however, so I might have to wait!  Big thanks to my pal /u/BaronScarpia for the sample!\\n\\n>**89/100**\\n\\n****\\n\\n**Aberlour 12-year old Non-Chill-Filtered, 48% abv**\\n\\n* **Color:** see above\\n\\n* **On the nose:** Again we\\'re burying ourselves in chocolate, only this time it\\'s dark, concentrated, bitter chocolate, which I adore.  Some very appealing mixtures of sweet, slightly bitter, and spicy flavors present themselves: burnt sugar, dry orange rind, tad of mint, allspice, and really nice balanced chewy sherry fruit, like prunes, dates, raisins, dried apricots.  A little walnuts and coffee show up too.\\n\\n* **Taste and finish:** I get much of what was in the nose, and that\\'s fine by me.  Dark bitter chocolate, nutty, and espresso with cream and sugar.  Actually I\\'m thinking it\\'s a lot like tiramisu with the espresso.  Damn.  Also, faint chiles?  Finish is long, but somewhat gentler than the A\\'bunadh, with sweetness, spice, and a little touch of smoke, reminding me of chipotle peppers.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m gonna have to call this my favorite heavily sherried whisky I\\'ve had so far.  While I love the big power of the A\\'bunadh and Mac CS, I\\'m really into the impressive balance of this 12.  It seems that all its elements - the dried fruit, nuts, slight bitter spice, and so on - play against one another without any one ever taking over.  It\\'s so delicious and I only wish it were more readily available.  I might\\'ve given this an even higher score if my untouched bottle of Glenfarclas 105 weren\\'t staring me down, daring me to pay it some attention (and to leave room in my scale).  All in due time!  Thanks for reading.\\n\\n>**91/100**',\n",

It needs more oomph or something dammit. Anything. \\n\\n* Finish: smooth, light, fruity, spicy oak/chocolate/tannin linger. \\n\\nToo weak for my tastes. The body is good though. This is like Glenfarclas 105 to me: not what I was expecting and just something not quite right about it. It might be the type of sherry used (or not enough) or this is a dud bottle. I’ve had better sherried scotch, and had better scotch. I’m sorry, but I do not understand the adoration for this scotch. A prime example to me that ncf doesn’t good scotch make. I think the non-chill filtration is a marketing gimmick to be honest, and perhaps the 12 year old regular Aberlour isn’t that good. This isn’t bad scotch per se, just that for me it has no flavour, but I can appreciate the smoothness on the palate for 48% ABV. \\n\\n79/100 – decent, but nothing special. I’d drink it again, but wouldn’t buy a bottle. \\n\\nA’bunadh is way better. In fact, I regret spending $110 AUD on this when A’bunadh is the same price. Fuck my life.

       " \"**Aberlour Mega-Review** (#5,6,7,8)\\n\\nI am a huge fan of the sherried malts. The Aberlour 12 Double Cask was one of the first *good* scotches that I had the pleasure of receiving as a gift. It lifted me out of the Dewar's and Cutty Sark gutters I was laying in. For this reason Aberlour has a special place on my shelf (also a very meaningful gift). I decided to explore the Aberlour series as best as I could given Oregon's lack of selection. I finally got around to buying another bottle of NCF to do a proper review. The following is my experience with the Aberlour 12, 16, A'bunadh #40, and the amazing 12 NCF.\\n\\n\\n\\nReviews not done in one sitting. Left to rest for ~15-20 minutes before nosing or tasting. All taken neat except the A'bunadh.\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Double Cask Matured 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep Amber.\\n* **Nose:** Sherry, fruit--apple, hint of orange peel.\\n* **Taste:** Heavy Honey. Fruits, pears, apples and then fades (or is it overtaken?) into a peppery spice.\\n* **Finish:** Nothing too crazy. Medium Length. Sugary apples fading out to leave a huge pepper taste. Not a great finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe regular 12yr blew me away when I first had it. Now that I have had some time to really find my palate it doesn't seem *as* compelling. It is still a great dram for the price, and I will likely always stock it. But it isn't balanced too well -- especially in the finish.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 16yr 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Add some ruby to the 12yr.\\n* **Nose:** *Very* similar to the 12yr. Seems like it has picked up some more vanilla or toffee notes though.\\n* **Taste:** Very smooth. The pepper has lost its overpowering kick here. The woody/oaky elements come out more with the extra aging. Hints of that vanilla like a bourbon.\\n* **Finish:** Just a better finish than the 12yr. More robust sherry with the vanilla that steps aside slowly for the pepper to creep in to leave a warm longer finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent example of how a scotch can benefit from more time in the cask. It basically just took all the rough edges of that 12yr and smoothed them out to just build a better whisky from the same excellent foundation.\\n\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #40 60% w/water**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep deep red amber.\\n* **Nose:** The high ABV gave me some trouble here. I got big sherry notes (obviously). Oranges. Earthy/woody notes.\\n* **Taste:** It is almost as if someone took a dried fruit medley (prunes, dates, raisins etc) and just removed most of the sugar. You get huge fruity notes without the overpowering sweetness that would come along with it. Nutty flavors slide in and out. A peppery finish lingers behind all of this.\\n* **Finish:** Very long and warm. Transitions nicely from the complex fruit flavors into that warm hazelnut pepper. And then right when you think its going to fade you get the oaky flavors coming back.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had to drink this a few times and experiment with the water to figure out how to really enjoy this one. Drinking it neat is just murder on your taste buds and nose. Too much water and you lose too much character and its bores you. Once I found the sweet spot it became one of my favorites. I just wish I could try more batches (maybe that infamous #38).\\n\\n**92/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Non Chill-Filtered 48% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** In my dim light a nice red honey.\\n* **Nose:** Powerful sherry, raisins, dark chocolate.\\n* **Taste:** All the fruit. Seriously. Sherry with a hint of citrus. Raisins, fresh cherry, dates, prunes? There is definitely a nutty element here as well. Possible almond or hazelnut. It is fairly sweet with a touch of honey. \\n* **Finish:** This finish is solid. It isn't crazy long but it is exceptionally balanced. The fruits fade slowly to reveal a lingering sherry and spice and balance perfectly. The higher ABV keeps you warm throughout.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the winner of the lineup. The flavors might not be as pronounced as the A'bunadh but they just play off each other so much better. It is slightly more expensive than the normal 12yr which makes it an easy buy for the exceptional craft you get. I have a hard time believing this is the same 12yr just not filtered. If that is truly the case I am appalled they would tarnish so much scotch in the name of filtration. I am really disappointed this is [allegedly] being discontinued.\\n\\n**96/100**\",\n",

The nose is not particularly powerful. There is quite a bit spice present on the nose with some nice floral aromas behind the spiciness. I also got caramel and toffee notes, which I am more use to in bourbons. It makes me wonder if they use first-fill bourbon casks with the other half being the sherry barrels. While I get the spiciness that is not uncommon to sherry casks, there is less fruit present than I would have thought. The raisin is hidden behind all the other aromas. In the mouth, the first taste was of a sweet and floral, like chamomile tea. The sweetness I attributed to plums, apples, and honey. The fruit was certainly present, but it also was not particularly strong. I also got some oak and vanilla from the bourbon barrels. The finish was longer than I expected from a 43% abv. I wasn’t a huge fan of this in the mouth, but the finish certainly made up for it. It was long and spicy. The sherry finally made itself fully present and does not disappoint. The oak also was far more present in the finish than it was in the rest of the dram. The cinnamon and vanilla once again brought the bourbon notes. There was also a subtle sweetness of honey plums. I was surprised by the bitterness from tobacco, but I thought it added to the finish. I have to admit I had higher expectations from this when I bought it because I adore the A’bundah. However, this is a very good scotch. It may not had been the sherry bomb that I was expecting, but I thought the bourbon barrels really added to the complexity of this. I think this would be a lot better if it was offered non chill-filtered like the 12. \\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered (48% abv) ($40)**\\n\\nColor: amber\\n\\nNose: sherry, raisins, strawberries, grapes\\n\\nTaste: plums, currants, sherry, fruity, honey, floral\\n\\nFinish: cherry, plums, vanilla, grapes, toffee\\n\\nOverall: 88/100\\n\\nThe color is a tad bit lighter than the 16. The nose is much more powerful than the 16. Immediately, I get sherry characteristics of raisins and strawberries. I also got some vanilla. While this nose stronger than the 16, it is far less complex. The nose reminds me a lot of a more low-key version of one of my favorites, Aberlour A’bunadh. In the mouth, the plum that were present in the 16 really stand out. Along with currants and other fruits common in sherry. The honey and floral characteristics from the 16 were also present. The flavor is much stronger than in 16 and the mouthfeel was much more rich and creamy. The finish consisted of cherries and plums. With a vanilla flavor that reminded me of the vanilla in the A’bunadh. There were also strong grape notes with a bit of nutty toffee thrown in there. Overall, I like the NCF slightly better than the 16. It tastes very similar to a water-downed A’bunadh and is much more of the sherry bomb I was expecting with Aberlour. However, it is much more one note than the 16. The bourbon barrels and the extra years really add to the complexity of the 16, but the richness and strength of the flavors from the NCF tips the scales in its favor. Both of these are good scotches worth trying, but the NCF is nearly half the price of the 16 and at least its equal and in my eyes a bit better. I would have this on hand at all times if it were available around me, but I had to get this one from Fine Drams. Still neither matches up to the A’bunadh, which is one of my favorites.\\n',\n",

       " '**Aberlour 12, 40% ABV**\\n\\nAberlour represents, for me, one of the better bang-for-buck opportunities out there for when I’m wanting a scotch aged in sherry casks.  Their standard 12 is decent enough to my palate, and is, I think, a definite notch above the typical supermarket bottles like the Glenfiddich 12 or the Glenlivet 12 despite being comparatively priced.  Its closest competitor in terms of an entry-level sherrybomb is the Macallan 12, and it costs five bucks less here while being, I think, better overall.  Meanwhile, the non-chill filtered 12 is an entirely different beast, and it represents, on balance, a real step up from the standard (and presumably chill filtered) 12 that is quite worth its higher price tag—and since price point is a component of all my reviews, that element will be included here as well.\\n\\n**Nose**: Figs, strawberries, and marmalade all burst out at first, undoubtedly because of Aberlour’s sherry sherryness, but beneath are surprising notes of cream and vanilla extract.  High tea, anyone?\\n\\n**Body**: A tad thin, and much thinner than the 12 NCF, but still with a reasonable enough heft and weight that it isn’t out of character as an Aberlour.  Perhaps a slight negative, but not an overly detrimental one.\\n\\n**Palate**: Plenty of fruit, especially grapes and cherries, are present, but in a fruit tart sort of taste, since there are hints of spice flavors as well, like nutmeg, cinnamon, or even gingersnap.\\n\\n**Finish**: The creaminess from the nose makes an encore appearance, along with some leafier botanical notes as the finish tapers out into a medium linger.  Not terribly complex, but enjoyable just the same.\\n\\n**Price**: USD $37 at my local liquor store.  Worth every penny if you’re in the market for an entry-level sherrybomb, or you want a daily drinker with more character than the big supermarket brands.\\n\\n**Overall**: This isn’t a bad whisky by any means, but it’s sort of the Laphroaig 10 of sherried whiskies, by which I mean it’s a young expression that hits you hard with its main flavor.  But unlike similar products from larger distilleries, Aberlour 12 at least tries to offer a trifle of depth, whereas its competitors are largely one-trick ponies.  For this, it gets a more favorable final tally than it otherwise would have.  83/100\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 non-chill filtered, 48% ABV**\\n\\nThe 12 NCF does not appear on the core range of whiskies on their website, at least not anymore, which makes me worried that Aberlour may have discontinued it--can anyone smarter or more connected than I confirm whether it has been?  Google searches have yielded no definitive results.  It would be a damn shame if production on it has been discontinued, because it is a mighty fine dram.\\n\\n**Nose**: Grapes, dates, and figs leap out first from the sherry—this is Aberlour, after all—and some grain or wheat beneath it, like you’re munching on toast with jam for breakfast, except way better.\\n\\n**Body**: A lot of depth and texture, which, on top of the lack of chill filtration, the higher ABV compared to the standard 12 probably helps with.  Syrupy, but not too overly so—simply full and rounded in feel.  Very enjoyable.\\n\\n**Palate**: The jam and sherry from the nose continues, but are joined by flavors of molasses, maple, blackberries, strawberries, and plums.  It’s not enough to simply call it “fruity;” I could detect a lot of different individual fruit flavors, and they interacted together quite pleasantly and with seemingly little effort.  I’m reviewing this in September, but really, it’d be soooooo on point during the winter.\\n\\n**Finish**: Smooth with a slight burn, decidedly above average for a 12 year old scotch.  Lingers a decent length and tapers out into a final burst of jammy sweetness at the very end, which was a rather satisfying note to end the dram on.  Let this be a lesson: chill filtration makes scotch worse.\\n\\n**Price**: USD $55 in my neighborhood and roughly the same online, which I think is an entirely reasonable price point for the quality and depth of what you’re getting.  The standard 12 is, like I said, in the $35-40 neighborhood and represents a decent bang-for-buck buy in its own right, but really, these are two different whiskies and are priced accordingly.\\n\\n**Overall**: This is, like the Old Pulteney 12, one of the best exhibits of evidence that age isn’t the be-all, end-all with scotch, and that you can still get an excellent whisky without shelling out for the increasingly pricey 15-21 year old expressions.  The layers of depth in the palate and the smoothness of the finish speak to the quality that electing to not chill filter can impart, and makes it a decidedly superior product to the standard 12.  Definitely not a scotch for those of you who don’t care for the sherry-crazed potions that Aberlour concocts, but otherwise, definitely worth a go.  89/100',\n",
       " 'Greetings, r/scotch! Rmill3r here with another whisky review. Aberlour was a distillery that I lost hope with from the get-go (much like Ardbeg). Their entry-level single malt did not impress me and had a nasty tinge to the palate and finish. People suggested I had a bad batch but I\\'ve tried it from other sources as well, and I just don\\'t think that\\'s the case. Still, people pushed me to try the NCF version. \"It\\'s *worlds* better!\" they say. Well, let\\'s see how simply *not* doing something to a whisky can change it . . .  \\n__________________________________________________________\\n**Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered, Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky**; 48% abv; ; $65.99 for a 750mL bottle locally; enjoyed a neat [dram](http://i.imgur.com/HjgXiMnh.jpg)\\n___________________________________________________________\\n\\n- **Atmosphere:** Haven\\'t been listening to a lot of music while drinking whisky lately. This time I was watching Netflix\\'s original series, [*Orange is the New Black*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zzenkrKIp4). Apparently, it\\'s based on a real memoir. It\\'s unique, funny, and insightful, so well worth the watch.\\n\\n- **Color:** Orange-ish amber\\n\\n- **Nosing:** Similar to the standard 12 but more pronounced. Bubble gum, solid smokey sherry, fresh fruits, hard watermelon candy, orange rind, Werther\\'s Original butterscotch, and rosy floral rounding it off\\n\\n- **Tasting:** Oily and rich mouthfeel, cinnamon, peppery spices, raspberries, bubble gum, Werther\\'s Original butterscotch\\n\\n- **Finish:** Slightly warm, bubble gum, medium to long, still metallic and sour like the 12 Double Cask Matured, and eventually becomes really cool like you were sucking on a mint. \\n\\n- Score: **80/100**\\n\\nIt\\'s certainly an improvement on the original Aberlour 12. With no other frills or gimmicky tricks to this whisky, simply *not* chill filtering this spirit makes a whole lot of fruitful difference. But if anything, it just makes the aspects of the original 12 that I didn\\'t like *that* much worse. There\\'s still this sour metallic-meets-plastic artifical flavor and aroma that I just can\\'t help but pick out of the Aberlour distillery.\\n\\nTo be clear, I wouldn\\'t refuse a dram of this. Oh, no, far from it! This can be *quite* good in many respects. Other than that metallic/plastic sour note I mentioned, the nose and palate are bountiful. But that artificial blemish is still just that . . . a blemish, and it ruins the overall experience for me and makes the $25 bump from the original not worth it.\\n\\nSo I continue to hope that distilleries experiment with NCF versions of their crowd pleasers, but this one\\'s just too little, too late. \\n\\n___________________________________________________________________\\n\\n**Related Reviews**\\n\\n- [Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1g0d3g/review_no_14_aberlour_12_sherry_is_as_sherry_does/)',\n",

A lot of flavor and overall a very good scotch.  A bit spicy due to it’s high ABV but it mellows out nicely with water.  The more time you give it the more it opens.   My chief negative marks are:  no statement on coloring, It’s a little pricy and sometimes hard to find.  Compared to CS Macallan, a bit more rough around the edges and also no age statement, but very much worth purchase for a special event, especially for us sherry scotch fans.

I think they all rank very close (if not better in some cases) to most of the Macallan offerings but often at a better price.  I personally feel this distilleries’ expressions is one of the best values available.  Again my only real complaints lie in if they use coloring, and as tasty as the NCF is compared to the 12 YO Double Cask, I feel they could save time and perhaps money by skipping the filtration.  But hey that’s my 2 cents.  In the meantime I recommend picking up a bottle from this distillery if you have not as of yet.  \\n\\n   ',\n",

The problem is that these compounds contribute quite a lot to the flavour and texture of the whisky.\\n\\nThe reason this is done is because these compounds can make the whisky go cloudy, which would make the uninformed consumer think something is wrong and not buy it.

Definitely darker than the last but I have no idea if it\\'s coloring or cask influence\\n* **Nose:** A hint of dried red fruits off the bat with some raisins specifically, opens up into some sweet wood and sweet green apples, not too sour. Not too solventy for the heat on the palate.\\n\\n* **Palate:** Some instant spice and pepper with some nice heat, citrus and oak, light pepper\\n\\n* **Finish:** Heat sticks around for a while, great length on this for what was hinted at by the nose and taste. Wood stays fading out into sweetness and warm alcohol tingles\\n\\n* **ABV Guess:** To be honest I\\'m not quite sure. I\\'d guess anywhere around the 43-46% range, just because it feels stronger than a typical 40%, but nowhere near the stronger end. If it\\'s a 40% though, it\\'s great for it.\\n\\n**Overall:** 88/100\\n\\n**Revealed to be:** Aberlour 12 NCF\\n\\nAdditional Notes:\\n\\nSo this was actually one of the samples I was looking forward to. I knew it was in there somewhere, and came highly recommended by scotchit. It definitely had the hints of what I was expecting on the nose, and was similar to a \"clean/cool\" version of the a\\'bunadh in my opinion. What threw me was how the overall sweet nose translated to a more spicy woody focused palate. The finish had some visiting wood, but was great with the heat and fading sweetness. Overall this is definitely something I would commit a full bottle to. I was a bit worried it would seem like a weaker but still great version of the a\\'bunadh, but it stands on its own easily. On a side note, a little proud that I managed to catch the bit of extra abv in the sample, I wasn\\'t quite sure if I would be able to notice as I\\'m pretty new to this.\\n',\n",
       " \"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another review.  and boy is it a good one.  you may have had **[this aberlour 12](http://i.imgur.com/G5YzB.jpg)** before.  it is a double cask 12 year old that I much enjoyed on the cheap.  this new \\n**Aberlour 12 unchillfiltered 96 proof** is a giant step up.  I had been seeing it in my store for a while but I had other whisky to buy and I thought it was just a renewed packaging.  boy was I wrong.  this is a completely different Aberlour than I've ever had.\\n\\n* Color – Reddish Gold\\n* Nose – sweet sherry, cherries and raspberry jam.  Tart apple pie, rose\\n* Taste – sweet mother of god… I mean,  Sweet fruits, fresh berries off the vine, tangy malty airy marizpan.  Brown sugar pralines, a ballet of sherried oak.\\n* Finish – like a warm cozy bed in the morning of a cold of winter\\n\\n\\nOne of the most enjoyable and balanced sherried single malts ever.  not being chill filtered has really made it stand out.  I quite enjoy the A'bunadh as well but this is as near perfect as any sherried whisky I've ever had.  It just narrowly escapes being the best next to Macallan Cask Strength.  I highly recommend this single malt. it was $48usd in my area and I almost passed it up.  again, perfectly balanced. and sensibly sweet.  I'm wasting time writing now when I could be having another dram, and you're wasting time reading this when you could be buying it right now!\\n\\n>97/100--glorious ambrosia.  \",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour 12 NCF** - 48% - NCF - 12 years old - made by Aberlour\\n\\n**Nose**: Sour pears, green apples, plums, barley, sherry\\n\\n**Taste**: Creamy, red fruits, bitter wood. Red onions. Lemon and orange.\\n\\n**Finish**: Malt, chocolate, stale coffee, fruity, oak. Sour. \\n\\nThis just doesn't do it for me. I like it more than the regular Aberlour 12, but it's not my jam. In fact, I've had both 12s, the 16, and the a'bunadh, and I wasn't crazy about any of them. I'll give the a'bunadh another try sometime, but I kind of want to write off this distillery as simply not being for me. I will say, though, the ABV and NCF of this whisky make it a decent enough occasional sipper.\\n\\n80/100\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Review #74-76, Whisky Network #143-145\\n\\nA few low key sherried malts here to try out not named, A’bunadh, glendronach, or Glenfarclas. I like to consider myself to have a strong love for a sherried scotch but its started to lead me farther up the price spectrum. I thought these samples would give me the opportunity to settle a bit back down that (except for this specific Edradour as it might not be possible to pick up any more – alas it should have been sub $100 when it was available.)

A little sweetness from the fruit.\\n\\nFinish: a little bitter oak at the back, lots of warm woody notes to go with a lingering spice\\n\\nThis used to be one of my hands down favorite sherried expressions.

       " \"Memories of Ice Storm '98. I was living in Montreal, was a teenager, had just gotten back to School and heard all the teachers give us the same old speech about being behind and needing to catch up. Our house had been broken into, so we were in the process of assessing everything that was taken, and then the whole world froze over.\\n\\nOn the first day I went out and bought booster packs of Battletech cards.\\n\\nJump ahead 15 years, and I'm in Toronto, coming back from an early Xmas at the in-laws, and the world is frozen. We have power this time, but the scene is very evident in my mind. The world is frozen again. Time for a dram to celebrate having power and not losing my pets (Geckos last time, luckily cats are more hardy and we had power this time).\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered** is the third of the Aberlour 12 line, and let me just take this serene, nice moment to tell you that it's really friggin hard to tell these three apart. Not by taste, that's easy, I'm talking about in normal conversation. Seriously Aberlour, could you not have given them a nick-name or something? Dick, Sam, and Hephaestus? I mean, I mention I like Aberlour 12 and all of a sudden I have to explain the intricate details between the three almost similar named ones.\\n\\nAnyway, back to a happy time and trying out this nice dram. It's Non Chill-Filtered and served at a higher Abv. than the other two offerings. Also, like the Sherry Cask, it's aged exclusively in Sherry Casks, and not mixed with Bourbon casks.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to /u/dustlesswalnut for sending me a dram of this in a long ago swap. I'm just getting to it now, and I'm very happy I get to finish up the Aberlour 12 collection.\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Abv:** 48%\\n\\n**Colour:** Orange wood\\n\\n**Nose:** Raspberry, currant, anise, strawberry jam cooking, cloves, cherry cough syrup, ginger candy\\n\\nRight off the bat you can tell it's stronger than the usual Sherry Cask. There's a lot more strength to it, punching you in the nose. Some spice, but this is mostly red fruit smell all the way.\\n\\nCan't smell Sulphur though, so maybe I'm just lucky in that I don't notice it.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cherry medicine, strawberry, licorice, jam, grape oil, ginger\\n\\nFirst off, this is thick. Like drinking juice concentrate thick. And oily. Like that time you mixed oil and jam and just drank it straight.\\n\\nNo? Just me then? Okay.\\n\\nMore spices in the taste, and they slowly come out as time goes one. Mellow. Almost like the A'bunadh, but missing some elements.\\n\\n**Finish:** Sherry, earth, grapes, acidic, ham, weak watermelon, salt\\n\\nNow the heavy sherry influence comes in, and there's an acidic, almost meaty taste to it all. Again, close to what I remember about the A'bunadh, but not quite there.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** So the big question is: Where are my pants?\\n\\nWait, no, that's not the current question, it's the one the judge asks me all the time.\\n\\nThe current question is: Where does the NCF fall in the Aberlour line. So we start with the 10, which is as good as the 12 year Double Cask. Sure the 12 year DC is a little better, but for the money, it's not adding much, and the balance on each are off. \\n\\nThen the Sherry Cask, as it has the little extra sherry influence over the others and tastes nice. Then you have this one. The mouth feel is better, and the flavours are more present. Yet none can shine a sulfuric candle to the A'bunadh, so that's where the NCF stays. If I had to choose, I'd probably still buy the Sherry Cask, as the small increase in quality probably isn't worth that much of a price increase.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n*Scotch review #134, Speyside #42*\\n\\n*Other Aberlour Reviews*\\n\\n* [Aberlour 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/15y8al/aberlour_10_review/)\\n\\n* [Aberlour 12 year Double Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1lggll/aberlour_12_year_double_cask_matured_review_from/)\\n\\n* [Aberlour 12 year Sherry Cask](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1bnrse/aberlour_12_sherry_cask_review/)\\n\\n* [Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 45](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1mb4g1/aberlour_abunadh_batch_45_review/)\",\n",
       " \"For a few years now, I would have called myself a “Rum drinker”, but that probably wasn’t totally accurate. I liked a few decent rums, and I could stand them neat. Recently I started trying other types of alcohol, and absolutely fell in love with Scotch. In my explorations I eventually stumbled across sherry Scotch (not all that hard to do really). Needless to say from the review pool, I am now a huge fan of Sherry Cask Scotches. I have a large “to get” list, and many of my purchases (and my future reviews) moving forward are going to involve broadening my selection and trying styles I have only had once or never at all. I feel I have reached a point now where my reviews may actually mean something, so here we go!\\n\\n\\n**Tasting Method:** .5 oz at a time, and 2.5oz total for each review. I revisited it across 5 nights to get the best perspective that wasn't tainted from one day.\\n\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**Dalwhinnie 15 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Highland, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Green apples at the forefront with charcoal on the edge of the smell. Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.\\n\\n**Taste:** This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice. \\n\\n**Finish:** Both sour and sweet elements carry over, hanging onto a bit of the charcoal note as well. The floral notes in the nose come back here at the end of the taste, but I can’t put my finger on any particular flower names….it is just floral. A decent yet light mouth feel. The flavor lingers for 1-2 minutes.\\n\\n**Rating:** 84/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I’ve had my ups and downs with this Scotch. Overall it’s a pretty low key and is trying to be as inoffensive as possible. It’s very simple, its major elements are sweet, and it doesn’t really leave a characteristically defining impact on me. This is what I imagine an “okay” lowland would taste like, which is one style I have yet to actually try. Out of everything I currently have, this is where I would start someone new to Scotch tasting.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 10 Year Fine Oak**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 40%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Overall a light nose, with white grapes and green apples being the primary elements. Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived. \\n\\n**Finish:** Aftertaste is rich but un-abrasive, with vanilla, mild spiced cinnamon (certainly of sherry origin) and a background of oak. It is a pronounced aftertaste, but lingers for only about 1-2 minutes. Very little mouth feel, but there is some. \\n\\n**Rating:** 88/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is nice, if a bit simple. I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background. \\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 12 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Grapes and apples to about equal degrees, with maybe a touch of cherry. A spiciness that wraps itself nicely into the initial fruit aroma, with a lingering oak background. It’s nice, not too overwhelming but certainly appetizing. \\n\\n**Taste:** Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. \\n\\n**Finish:** The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes. This has a good mouth feel that isn’t too intense, but is intense enough to make itself known on the tongue. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a good 2-3 minutes, certainly satisfying. \\n\\n**Rating:** 91/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I really like this Scotch, it’s not trying to be the most complex or intricate masterpiece but it is amazingly solid at what it is trying to do and embraces what it brings to the table. It is refined enough to sit and analyze, but casual enough to be a daily drinker. Out of all my Sherry Scotches, if I HAD to pick one to keep around as an “affordable” drinker it would be this (let’s hope it never comes to that)!\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 18 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet fruits galore, a bit hard to peg down but cherry, apples, grapes and some berry I can’t put my finger on. The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. \\n\\n**Taste:** Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.\\n\\n**Finish:** The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste. The mouth feel is much more prevalent and hot on the tongue, and without a decent enough amount of time could very quickly numb it. The flavor lingers for easily 3-4 minutes plus.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is really spectacular and exactly what I was expecting out of a “high end” Scotch. Complexity that leaves me entirely fulfilled while keeping every element of said complexity in the aftertaste to be enjoyed for as long as possible. This stuff is pretty expensive and is not something I would ever drink daily, but boy do I wish I could.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan Cask Strength**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 58.4%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** A very vibrant and rich aroma with elements of caramel, spice, hot cinnamon, sweet grapes, red apples, and cherry. Very powerful, and a few good whiffs leave a mild sting/numbness in the nose which is really great.\\n\\n**Taste:** A bit of toffee right before a hot cinnamon and spice blast, intense but not overboard. It doesn’t take long for the most intense part to pass, where afterwards come in caramel, a myriad of different apples but mainly red, sweet grapes, a bit of cherry, a tinge of bitter on the tongue. All the flavors are very deep, and I wouldn’t say one of them takes the “background” roll. All very upfront and in your face.\\n\\n**Finish:** Hot spice lingers on the tongue, with a nice oak note coming through now. Along with it are cinnamon and apples ringing on the tongue, a very vibrant and deep mouth feel. The taste lingers for 3-4 minutes plus. A bit of numbing of the tongue which I love.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** Wow, this is superb! I don’t think it’s as evolving in taste as the 18, but all of its flavors are much more powerful and rich. I really enjoy Macallan for their focus on hot spice notes, and boy does this have it in force. I hunted down the last two bottles I could find locally, and I’m glad I did. I can only hope it comes back into production sometime. This along with the A’bunadh make me wish more distilleries would consistently release cask strength batches. \",\n",
       " \"Hello fellow malt heads, today I've got some notes about my time spent with Aberlour last night while I caught up on some UFC (162 - Roger Gracie's debut). It's been particularly warm (88 degrees!) in my area over the past week and so I brought out my Aberlour samples and my tasting journal and wrote up some notes while I enjoyed some MMA. Organizing my notes this morning while rocking out to some Queens of the Stone Age.\\n\\nAfter my first expression from Aberlour with the 12 year old Double Cask Matured I was eager to sit down with the flag-ship expressions (A'Bunadh and 12NCF). I figured I should taste them all in order to get a good feel for their spirit from start to finish. Here are my tasting notes from the night and one extra set of notes from back in June during a group tasting with a friend who brought his bottle of A'Bunadh Batch #30, Yum! Cheers\\n\\n----\\n\\n[Previous Review notes of **Aberlour 12 Double Cask**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1gqqol/aberlour_12_double_cask_matured_speyside_single/camtv6c) - This was my Review #31\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *43%* \\n\\n- **Price** $40 - 750ml bottle\\n  \\n**[Tasted Neat](http://i.imgur.com/Dz3ZsVS.jpg)** - [Pictured here on the right](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)\\n\\n- **Color:** Deep Amber, Liquid Copper\\n\\n- **Nose:** Very faint sherry influence, red apple, slight burn, orange pith, touch of vanilla, upfront medicinal alcoholic wall. *A simple barely sweet and bitter slightly burn-y nose that leaves you searching but comes up short before the alcohol*\\n\\n- **Taste:**  Watery-light oily, soft intro, light citrus, sour fruit, warms and thickens to a hot spiciness, pepper, astringent. *Not very impressed with the palate here, very lacking and somewhat in-line with the simple nose*\\n\\n- **Finish:**  Peppered apple, sour citrus, hot and fast on the palate, fades leaving a pepper flavor and a zing of light burnt sugar. *A quick hot finish of citrus, apple and pepper with a light toffee trail*\\n\\n**Summary** \\nWell, this feels like very young spirit to me, I was expecting a bit more sherry and oak in this to be honest but it was a pretty shallow nose. I hit a few fruits and slight sherry and then a brick wall of medicinal alcoholic vapor. The palate was anti-climactic, watery to light oily, hot and sour and peppery, into a finish of the same apple, pepper, citrus that trails off into a weak toffee flavor.\\n\\n**72/100** \\n*This one was a complete miss for me, didn't enjoy any part of it really. Money is better spent elsewhere imo. I think I'm coming to find out I'm not a fan of super peppery malts and blends*\\n\\n**Update:** Now that I've had the big hitters from Aberlour I feel this original score was a bit harsh as I know the destination this malt is going for. After my tasting last night I would probably bump it up to **79/100**. It's not a terrible malt, but not amazing either. It really loses a lot of the flavor profile with the chill-filtering, this is a great example of what that process does to single malt. Still not a fan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Review #57**\\n----\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non-chillfiltered** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *48%*  \\n\\n**[Enjoyed Neat](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)** - Middle glass\\n\\n- **Price** $60 - 750ml bottle \\n\\n- **Color:** Light Amber hue, Un-filtered honey\\n\\n- **Nose:** Sherry oak, strawberry preserves, salty, honey, almonds, marzipan, fresh river air, airy sense, damp forest, pleasantly complex\\n\\n- **Taste:** Sweet Bursting sherry, berry pie filling, warm spices, sweetness, sherry oak, thickens and warms, slight orange peel note, medium oily, complex - Full bodied and pleasantly oily mouth feel.\\n\\n- **Finish:** Dark fruits, great oak flavor and some almonds, a little peppery with faint notes of oranges, warm long finish that is smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n**Summary**  \\nA huge improvement over the standard 12 year expression. The complexity has been doubled here guys, the NCF is a very nice Speysider. I could see getting a full bottle of this one, they've really hit the sweet spot of their spirit in this expression.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the palate and finish most on this dram, the nose is definitely enjoyable too but the flavors here are what hooked me.

Long finish that continues with those big fruity notes until it dries out.\\n\\n- **Taste:** Blast of fig, berries and sherry along with vanilla cremes, almond and pie crust with dusted cinnamon spice and sweet oak.\\n\\n- **Finish:** Hot, powerful and delicious! Succulent dark fruits like boysenberry jam or blackberry cobbler, notes of dark chocolate and pepper with oak underneath. \\n\\n**Summary**  \\nThis was my first Cask Strength sherry bomb experience and it was a great one. I remember this one being a little better than the Batch #40 below It seemed to have more of those deep sherry and fruity flavors than the the Batch #40 and is just a few points higher for me. It's definitely cool to see that there are differences batch to batch, keeping a consistent product seems like witchcraft in Whisky so I don't fault them at all.

There is a slight bitter note on the palate this time and the palate is just slightly less impressive this time around. Not sure if it is due to the different batches but it seems thats a possibility. This is still a GREAT whisky, I just remember the Batch #30 being so much more flavorful and better experience.

       " 'Scotchit Review #16-17 Aberlour 12 NCF and Macallan 12 side by side. \\n\\nSample of the Aberlour obtained via r/scotchswap from /u/Ethanized. As I prepare for my trip to Scotland in a few weeks, I\\'m working through my remaining samples. Best to have a better idea what to look for when I\\'m there.  I didn\\'t intend this as a side by side, but half way through the Aberlour I wanted to compare it to something. Got some Macallan 12 and here we are.  But that\\'s why there\\'s no picture of the Macallan. \\n\\nConsumed neat in a Copita and a similar stemless glass.  I felt like a different glass tonight.  \\n\\n\\n**abv**: 48% for the Aberlour. 43% for Macallan \\n\\n**color** Golden amber, with light pinkish hue from the sherry casks. Aberlour is a little darker and more pink. \\n____________________\\n*Aberlour 12 NCF*\\n\\n**Nose:** Raspberries with cream. Shortbread. Then darker fruits...dates or figs? A little cereal grain.  Just a whiff of ethanol. \\n\\n**Taste:**  A little surprising heat. The red fruits, vanilla and shortbread are there, blending like a raspberry, vanilla custard tart.  But then some oak shows up, lending some wood spice and tannin. \\n\\n**Finish:**  Rather warming. Somehow a Scotch at 48% can be more warming than Bourbon at over 50%. Quite long, sweet cereal and creamy berries. Muted, like a creamsicle is to oranges, but with raspberry. Really nice. \\n\\n_____________________\\n*Macallan 12 (Sherry cask)* \\n\\n**Nose** Much more cereal forward and less red fruit on the nose, but Strawberries are there. Vanilla.  Prominent honey that is missing from the Aberlour.  Almost no alcohol. \\n\\n**Taste**  Very refined (I won\\'t say \"smooth\") and very well integrated.  Honey cereal and shortbread cookies, with just a hint of strawberry.  Nothing amiss. No harshness, not very tannic. \\n\\n**Finish**  Shorter, less warming but very nice and the strawberry flavor actually shows up more here along with some sweet shortbread cookie. \\n\\n**Conclusion:**  Turned out more interesting with the side by side. I really like the Aberlour 12 NCF, but I gained some respect for the Macallan now on my third dram of it.  I think the Aberlour is better, it\\'s bolder, has more aggressive flavors (Sherry in particular) and a bit more alcohol punch. But I can see why people like the Macallan.  It\\'s flavors were woven together a little better and it has no missteps. The finish was probably the biggest gap, with the Aberlour winning there. Nose, slight edge to Aberlour and taste was about a tie.  Scores: B+ at 88 for Aberlour NCF and a high B at 86/100 for the Macallan. \\n\\nEDIT: spelling fixed.  I\\'m used to Irish spellings. ',\n",

I'm curious what type of sherry casks this was aged in. I'd be shocked if it's PX, even Oloroso seems like it would leave this a little sweeter. Anyway, dried fruits and toffee accompany dark chocolate. It's quite pleasant, just not what I think of when I hear Aberlour or Sherry Cask matured. \\n\\n**Finish:** Not surprisingly, the oak notes come in and it gets bitter very quickly. Not too bitter though, and it has that tobacco note that I usually associate with older scotches. \\n\\n**Summary:** This stuff isn't bad, I certainly like it more than the double cask.

       " \"Scotchit, how're you? Here's a quick and painless couple of notes about a dram from one of my favourite distilleries. Google Aberlour 12 and you're likely to pull up 3 or more different bottles. There's the Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured, there's the Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered and this one. This one is matured in ex-Oloroso sherry casks and displays natural colouring though has been chill-filtered. It was £30/€35/$47 for 1 litre.\\n\\n*Aberlour 12 Year Old Sherry Cask Matured, Speyside single malt, ABV 40%, chill filtered, no e150a*\\n\\n- Nose: Initially salty caramel, icing sugar, white chocolate, buttercream and a hint of pineapple, up close central but soft sherry, honey, baked oranges, raisins, Christmas mincemeat, leather and polish, red wine notes, woody towards the end and slightly floral\\n\\n- Palate: Rich molten toffee, chocolate cocoa powder, dried fruits, cherries, strawberry, significant malt coating everything, a little vanilla cream, Christmas pudding, with air slightly minty, some salt, mellow tobacco, oak influence throughout, watery mouthfeel \\n\\n- Finish: Warm honey, hint of nutmeg, chewy malt, towards the end more bitter with slight cloves, blood orange juice and more fresh oak influence. Little burn at all, palatable as water. \\n\\nFairly predictable nose sherry-wise but then throws a few curve balls with the salt, icing sugar, pineapple juice and more woody and floral than I've experienced with Aberlours before, though also less spice. What struck me moving on to the tasting was the maltiness underlining each flavour. It also becomes more savoury towards the end. There's an every present woody quality to this dram, reasonably subtle in comparison to ex-bourbon scotches but an indication of it age. In addition to being quite woody there's just not a lot of punch in this dram at all. It's [Auchentoshan 12 syndrome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/vxle8/auchentoshan_12_community_review/c58hssp) The flavours, mouthfeel, burn all suffer from being over diluted. I imagine this may be much better at around 43-46% ABV. The [Aberlour 10 Sherry Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ti8u6/aberlour_10_year_old_sherry_finish_a_review/) as an example is much better punch to the face in this regard.

It's not a bad dram, and it's certainly a decent sherried dram, it's just a little bi-polar.

       " \"Aberlour 15 Double Cask Matured (sherry and bourbon casks)\\n\\n40% ABV\\n\\nIntroduction: This was my first Aberlour experience. I’ve heard great things about Aberlour A’Bunadh and have always almost bought it at the store except I would run into something else I’ve also had my eye on. So when my friends and I gathered for a small little whisky tasting, I was excited to try their 15yr old double cask as my introduction to the distillery. Here we go:\\n\\nNose: Sweet sherry, some spice, herbal vegetal notes, some chocolate\\n\\nPalate: sweet start, sherry coming through nicely. Pepper, oak, a little bit of smoke, it’s a nice smoldering smoke. \\n\\nFinish: Semi-sweet citrusy finish. Short.\\n\\nConclusion: nose is the best part of this, but overall it is good. I wish I could’ve had this at higher ABV. Feels like the other notes were just too subdued and the finish too short. My friend who owned the bottle loves it, and I can see why he enjoys it. But for me, it's not deep enough in what it does (again, probably due to ABV) that I am not as big a fan. However, given its price point, which was ~$60, this is a great buy\\n\\n84/100\",\n",

       " \"Aberlour 15y handfilled (bourbon cak)\\n\\nThis bottle was filled by myself at Aberlour distillery when I did a Speyside trip back in 2014. The tour at Aberlour wasn't that impressive, because I can't seem to remember much of it (but that could also be because it was the last day of a week filled with scotch...).\\n\\nThe handfilled opportunity is pretty touristy (as much is at Speyside distilleries). There are 2 big tuns in the tasting room (one bourbon, one sherry) where you can draw a bottle from (so no single cask, it's a batch). But in the tasting at the end of the tour you could taste them, and one of them was so good that I bought a bottle. Let's see if it holds up.\\n\\nI notice that the above stated sounds a bit negative, so let me say also: I always have a great time in the Speyside, really nice people and whisky vibes over there (though some distilleries might be a bit over the top, touristy wise).

Very pleasant and rich nose. Truly a summer's dram.\\n\\nTaste:\\nA really nice mouthfeel, a lovely thickness and oilyness with lots of body. Nice tingly feeling on the tongue. Flavourwise there is more bourbon notes. But also something I missed in the nose: oranges.\\n\\nFinish:\\nEver so long. With aniseed and a peppery/hot aftertaste.\\n\\nComments:\\nA big bourbon-cask bomb. You have to like it, it can be to sweet for some. I love drams like these once in a while.

       " \"Aberlour 16 year Double Cask Matured  $65 43% ABV\\n\\n**Color**: A light, golden copper\\n\\n**Nose**:  Not a very powerful nose, but rich and fruity.  The fruits, primarily pears and peaches with a bit of dried apple, are garnished with a bit of citrus, mostly orange.  Some honey and rock candy add sweetness underneath. \\n\\n**Taste**:  A buttery, creamy burst opens up in the mouth immediately.  The fruit is significantly diminished on the palate relative to the nose.  The nose reminds me of Arran's 14 year, which had a taste to match, yet this is a much different beast in the mouth.  Tiny bit of sweet sherry is in there, along with honey, apples, salted nuts, and tiny cinnamon and brown sugar notes.  Mouthfeel is moderate and balanced.\\n\\n**Finish**:  The finish fades at a rapid clip with some of the fruit lingering, this time primarily apple.  I love how the apple and pear notes battle back and forth in the nose and finish.  Honey also hangs out for a bit and then bids farewell to close out the party.\\n\\nAberlour is currently my favorite Scotch distillery along with Glendronach.  The 16 year expression, 12 year NCF and A'Bunadh are wondrous bottles.  The 16 year, with its complexity, yet light and delicate flavors remind me a lot of some Japanese expressions.  It is probably one of the most drinkable whiskies I own.  However, it could definitely do with a bit higher proof.  50% would be a good start.  The bourbon casks are nice foil to the sherry, and does explain some of the interesting bourbon notes buried under the honey, butter and fruit in the taste.  A fine, fine Scotch, but considering the A'Bunadh is around the same price, and the 12 year NCF is a good $20 cheaper, this isn't a value whisky.

Fades a bit too quickly.  \\n\\n\\n**conclusions:** What a mouth feel! Succulent. Unfortunately the finish isn't quite as big as I would want, with none of the big flavors sticking around. And, honestly, *where is the sherry?!* Yes, there is unmistakable raisin-sherry notes in the finish, but this isn't the bomb of even the 12 Double Cask. Rather un-Aberlour, this is.

High hopes that this will be right in my wheelhouse.\\n\\n**Color**: Iced tea, golden motor oil with thick legs\\n\\n**Nose (22/30)**: Clover honey, apple compote, cinnamon, clove, wassail bowl punch, butterscotch, pepper - a bit faint though on the aroma overall\\n\\n**Taste (42/50)**: starts almost flavorless and builds into hot ginger and pepper, hint of pineapple, evasive sweetness\\n\\n**Finish (17/20)**: hot sweet medium long brown sugar finish\\n\\n**Overall (81/100)**: I liked the Aberlour 12 Double Cask and really enjoyed the drip of a'bunadh I tried, so I felt predispositioned to like this.  It could use a more powerful nose, and the taste is pretty straight-forward, but it has a nice finish.  Very drinkable - I think it qualifies as a go-to dram for me.\\n\\n**BOTTOM LINE**: Good stuff!  This surely has some competition at this price point, but the flavor profile is to my liking.  Aberlour does something that works for me.  Definitely my favorite distillery so far.  Still looking for something a bit spicier that isn't just a tidal wave of sherry.  \\n\",\n",
       " \"Back again this Friday with a followup to the Aberlour 18 review I just posted. I received this sample back in February from /u/Schmibitar but never got around to reviewing it (along with ~25 other samples!)\\n\\nThe 12 NCF is a staple in my cabinet (I've got backups to last me a couple years!), the a'Bunadh is extremely solid and worth picking up now and again, and my first impression of the 18 is FANTASTIC!\\n\\nI had a strange time with this one-- read on!\\n\\n**Aberlour 16**\\n\\n*Price:* N/A\\n\\n*Color:* Whisky.\\n\\n*Region:* Highland\\n\\n*ABV:* 43%\\n\\n*Nose:* The little strawberry candies that come in cellophane that looks like... strawberries. Very slightly earthy, in a stale beer kind of way. Isopropyl alcohol\\n\\n*Palate:* Very thin on the palate, light vanilla and slightly floral. Not really much here.\\n\\n*Finish:* Extremely long alcohol burn and capsaicin spice. It takes 3-4 minutes or a few good swigs of water to get the burn to go down, but once it does there's a bit of of a fermented fruitiness, but I'm honestly reaching to get that.\\n\\n**82/100**\\n\\nThis one was quite a letdown. I'm not casting it aside entirely, after all it's a small sample that was bottled 10 months ago. It was stored in the dark and I made sure the caps were all tight, but there's a chance that something in the bottle before tainted it or something.\\n\\nThe alcohol burn was intense, and it wasn't an ethanol burn-- as I said, it tasted like rubbing alcohol. The strawberry on the nose was right up front with my nose *above* the glencairn , but other than the alcohol and capsaicin burn I was reaching pretty far for the rest of the flavors.\\n\\nI drank about 3/4 of this and set it down for ~45 minutes to let it get some air. It was noticeably less harsh with some lighter fruity notes and more manageable pepper, but it was still lackluster. I don't know, maybe it was swapped with some cask strength expression I've never tried?\\n\\nI would try this again from a fresh bottle-- if anything to satisfy my curiosity-- but I'm bummed that it didn't line up with the rest of my Aberlour experiences.\",\n",
       " \"*Aberlour pushed me to really enjoy scotch. I tried a few different malts before the 16yr (the Glens, Macallan, JW), but this one was truly eye-opening. I followed it up with some a’Bunadh which took some getting used to due to the high proof. I haven’t gone back since for a while just because I’ve been exploring the variety of whiskeys out there. A friend had an opened bottle, so I decided to come back home for a review.* \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Aberlour 16yr – 43%**\\n\\nCategory | Notes\\n:--|:--\\n**Setup:** | Neat, INAO glass, rested 20 minutes.\\n**Color:** | Amber.\\n**Nose:**  | Very light nose, just hints of caramel and oak. Also a mild background of sherry, but it’s very subtle. Much more so than the sherry bombs I’ve had recently. **22/30**\\n**Palate:** | The sherry comes through very well on the palate – I find that many sherried whiskies have an overwhelming sherry flavor, drowning out the whiskey notes. This one is definitely more subtly sherried, which I enjoy. Nice sweetness to balance out the dried fruits and oak. **32/35**\\n**Finish:** | Good finish – just enough warmth, and oak that goes for a minute. **32/35** \\n**Score:** | **86/100** \\n**Value:** | **3/5** @ $65 for 750ml\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAverage score to date: 79.7\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nVery nice pour, and still one of my favorites considering how easy it is to find and the price. I am curious how it compares to the 12 NCF since they are almost the same price in my area. My bet is that the 12 NCF is like a more hearty, rough and tumble, young brother of the 16yr. Either way, I do enjoy Aberlour’s approach to sherry, it’s probably my favorite so far.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWould I re-buy a bottle? Yes, but I'm going to keep exploring first.\",\n",
       " \"Hi Scotchit!\\n\\nBack home for Christmas, and my lovely parents decided to gift me this special flavour of Aberlour for my birthday. Being a fan of the 10 and the A'bunadh, I'm quite excited to try this. Unfortunately I left my glencairns in the burgh so this little sherry glass will have to do.\\n\\n***Aberlour Double Cask Matured 16 Years Old*** 43%\\n\\n***Price:*** N/A as it was a gift from the 'rents\\n\\n***Body:*** A deep amber, almost like a Rosé. \\n\\nThin, does not really have any legs.\\n\\n\\nOne thing I noticed was the amount of particles in the liquid; small specks dotted around. I haven't seen this in any of my other bottles. I wouldn't say it is cloudy, but perhaps it is non-chill-filtered? I know Aberlour have some expressions of their other lines that are NCF. It could also be due to the age maybe, as I don't own anything quite as old as this and maybe more came off the cask.\\n\\n***Nose:*** Big sherry presence, grapes, vanilla, a touch of woodiness, cinnamon.\\n\\n***Palate:*** Raisins, honey, caramelised sugar. Big oak presence, one can definitely notice the mix of Bourbon and sherry here. Lemon zest, slight saltiness, cough medicine.\\n\\n***Finish:*** Very smooth and quick. Sherry takes over with more lemon, a creamy sweetness and a tinge of burn.\\n\\n**Notes:** A very decent scotch. I cannot help but feel however that this would have been superb at cask strength. At 43%, I feel like the flavours struggle to really push through, and the mesh of sherry and bourbon makes it seem a bit confused as to where it should be going. I want to taste the full smack of sherry Aberlour is known for, along with a good mix of vanilla sweetness. With this I get a bit of both, but no oompf of any particularly distinct flavours. A longer finish would be nice also.\\n\\nSaying that, it is very mature and is very pleasant to drink. This would make a perfect apéritif, especially in summer. I enjoy the marriage of oak and sherry and the many floral notes. It is very good, but not quite there, therefore I think I'm going to give this an **82/100**.\\n\\n\\nI cannot comment so much on the price, but I would guess there are better value bottles out there. However if introducing someone to scotch or gifting it to someone who might not be an experienced connaisseur, I would definitely recommend this.\\n\\n**Next up:** I have quite a few bottles in the cabinet. Expect one of the following to be reviewed soon: Talisker 10, Laphroaig QC, Dalwhinnie 15, Glenmorangie Original.\",\n",

The Aberlour 16 has a really great mouth feel as well, thicker than many of the other Scotches I have in my modest little library.  It drinks easy, with a finish that I find very satisfying.  It has lots of bold sherry, but not an overwhelming amount.  The Aberlour 16 has just enough oak to give it a good spicy characteristic without making it taste like bourbon’s weak overseas cousin.   It is a thoroughly enjoyable Scotch for all you Speysiders out there.\\n\\nI must get the 12 next, to compare it, especially for value.

       " \"**Aberlour Mega-Review** (#5,6,7,8)\\n\\nI am a huge fan of the sherried malts. The Aberlour 12 Double Cask was one of the first *good* scotches that I had the pleasure of receiving as a gift. It lifted me out of the Dewar's and Cutty Sark gutters I was laying in. For this reason Aberlour has a special place on my shelf (also a very meaningful gift). I decided to explore the Aberlour series as best as I could given Oregon's lack of selection. I finally got around to buying another bottle of NCF to do a proper review. The following is my experience with the Aberlour 12, 16, A'bunadh #40, and the amazing 12 NCF.\\n\\n\\n\\nReviews not done in one sitting. Left to rest for ~15-20 minutes before nosing or tasting. All taken neat except the A'bunadh.\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Double Cask Matured 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep Amber.\\n* **Nose:** Sherry, fruit--apple, hint of orange peel.\\n* **Taste:** Heavy Honey. Fruits, pears, apples and then fades (or is it overtaken?) into a peppery spice.\\n* **Finish:** Nothing too crazy. Medium Length. Sugary apples fading out to leave a huge pepper taste. Not a great finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe regular 12yr blew me away when I first had it. Now that I have had some time to really find my palate it doesn't seem *as* compelling. It is still a great dram for the price, and I will likely always stock it. But it isn't balanced too well -- especially in the finish.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 16yr 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Add some ruby to the 12yr.\\n* **Nose:** *Very* similar to the 12yr. Seems like it has picked up some more vanilla or toffee notes though.\\n* **Taste:** Very smooth. The pepper has lost its overpowering kick here. The woody/oaky elements come out more with the extra aging. Hints of that vanilla like a bourbon.\\n* **Finish:** Just a better finish than the 12yr. More robust sherry with the vanilla that steps aside slowly for the pepper to creep in to leave a warm longer finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent example of how a scotch can benefit from more time in the cask. It basically just took all the rough edges of that 12yr and smoothed them out to just build a better whisky from the same excellent foundation.\\n\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #40 60% w/water**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep deep red amber.\\n* **Nose:** The high ABV gave me some trouble here. I got big sherry notes (obviously). Oranges. Earthy/woody notes.\\n* **Taste:** It is almost as if someone took a dried fruit medley (prunes, dates, raisins etc) and just removed most of the sugar. You get huge fruity notes without the overpowering sweetness that would come along with it. Nutty flavors slide in and out. A peppery finish lingers behind all of this.\\n* **Finish:** Very long and warm. Transitions nicely from the complex fruit flavors into that warm hazelnut pepper. And then right when you think its going to fade you get the oaky flavors coming back.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had to drink this a few times and experiment with the water to figure out how to really enjoy this one. Drinking it neat is just murder on your taste buds and nose. Too much water and you lose too much character and its bores you. Once I found the sweet spot it became one of my favorites. I just wish I could try more batches (maybe that infamous #38).\\n\\n**92/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Non Chill-Filtered 48% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** In my dim light a nice red honey.\\n* **Nose:** Powerful sherry, raisins, dark chocolate.\\n* **Taste:** All the fruit. Seriously. Sherry with a hint of citrus. Raisins, fresh cherry, dates, prunes? There is definitely a nutty element here as well. Possible almond or hazelnut. It is fairly sweet with a touch of honey. \\n* **Finish:** This finish is solid. It isn't crazy long but it is exceptionally balanced. The fruits fade slowly to reveal a lingering sherry and spice and balance perfectly. The higher ABV keeps you warm throughout.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the winner of the lineup. The flavors might not be as pronounced as the A'bunadh but they just play off each other so much better. It is slightly more expensive than the normal 12yr which makes it an easy buy for the exceptional craft you get. I have a hard time believing this is the same 12yr just not filtered. If that is truly the case I am appalled they would tarnish so much scotch in the name of filtration. I am really disappointed this is [allegedly] being discontinued.\\n\\n**96/100**\",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour 16 Double Cask Matured**\\n\\nColour: Dark Golden Orange.  I suspect artificial colour.\\n\\nNose: Mix of Speyside fruits and sherry notes, more the former.  Apples, pears, white grapes, wine, sugar, grains.\\n\\nPalate: Plums, figs, apples, sherry, pears, caramel, toffee, coco, corn syrup.\\n\\nFinish: Chocolate, honey, oak, cinnamon.\\n\\nThe flavour is nice and rich but fleeting with a short finish.  It's strange, I've had this bottle open a while now and I'm detecting less sherry notes than I remembered.  The bourbon maturation is dominating slightly, reminding me of familiar Speyside qualities.  This isn't bad at all, but really doesn't offer anything that interesting.  At 40% abv, I feel a stronger bottling is about the only thing that could elevate this.  The 10 is as good or better.  Still a fan of Aberlour.

Unfortunately, most of the liquor stores near me did not seem to cater to scotch drinkers, and most of those that did had no Aberlour at all (interesting fact: I did find both Macallan CS and Lagavulin 12 at one store, but the price points were too rich for me at $89.99 and $99.99, respectively). At the end of my search I found one store that had no A'bunadh, but the 12, the old 15 Sherry Cask, and the 16. Feeling indulgent (and a little miffed after all that searching), I sprung for the 16. Without further ado...\\n\\n**Aberlour 16 Double Cask Matured**: Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whiskey; 40% ABV (?). Paid $54.99 for the bottle (around $60 with tax) in the Chicago suburbs.

Quite enchanting.\\n*     Nose: Slight oaky vanilla, cocoa powder, ginger ale, very faint maraschino cherries. A vinous note is in the background.\\n*     Palate: Mouth-coating. Sweet tea, a slight sour bite on the edges of the tongue. Oak is ever-present. Where is the cocoa powder from the nose?\\n*    Finish: No burn. Long and botanic.\\n\\nScore: 85/100. I don't know what to think of the ABV on this one, as it is 3% less than everything I've been able to find on the internet. I'd have loved to taste the hint of cocoa I had in the nose, and this may be veering toward the too-oaky feeling I got when tasting Macallan 12 (not nearly as extreme as that, though). On the other hand, this dram satisfies my sweet-tooth like none other before, and I like that quite a bit. Makes me want to try the A'bunadh even more.\",\n",

Really pleasant oak, old leather, dates, and this odd note I can only describe as a salty, bbq type jerky. I\\'ve only had one other product that has had that jerky note to it - but it\\'s definitely here - a combination of salt/savory/slightly sweet.\\n\\n**Mouthfeel** Watery - little to no oils.

This is an Aberlour 16, which I believe has a modest amount of caramel added and is likely chill-filtered.\\n\\n**Nose:**  Raisin, molasses, maple syrup, red apple skin, pear, wood pulp, oatmeal, dry oloroso, and lime.  Hints of vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon.\\n\\n**Taste:**  Fruity and fairly woody, although this doesn't have the almost bourbon-like oak punch of the A'bunadh.  Oatmeal again surprisingly (part of that woody note) with apple skin, vanilla, banana, and orange.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Not terribly long, with lots of dry oak and spice.  Some cantaloupe and baked apples fill with cinnamon, clove and a few other spices I can't put my finger on.  (Cumin?).  Ends dry and woody with tannins building on the tongue over the dram.  The alcohol(?) gives a fairly noticeable 'tang' to this, despite the low ABV.  This is something I find in only a few distilleries, Glenlivet being another.  I relate it to the dry, sharp flavor of seltzer, and for me it's a negative impact.\\n\\n**Final notes:**  Not at all a bad dram, although I was expecting something a bit different than this.  There's something... harsh about it.  At 16 years this whisky has a very woody character, so if you like that kind of thing it might be a good choice.  That being said, it still retains that fruity speyside-like character with a dry finish.  This is somewhat reminiscent of a Glenlivet-style dram, although I think this has a much more interesting profile.\\n\\n**Final score: 87/100**\",\n",

The nose is not particularly powerful. There is quite a bit spice present on the nose with some nice floral aromas behind the spiciness. I also got caramel and toffee notes, which I am more use to in bourbons. It makes me wonder if they use first-fill bourbon casks with the other half being the sherry barrels. While I get the spiciness that is not uncommon to sherry casks, there is less fruit present than I would have thought. The raisin is hidden behind all the other aromas. In the mouth, the first taste was of a sweet and floral, like chamomile tea. The sweetness I attributed to plums, apples, and honey. The fruit was certainly present, but it also was not particularly strong. I also got some oak and vanilla from the bourbon barrels. The finish was longer than I expected from a 43% abv. I wasn’t a huge fan of this in the mouth, but the finish certainly made up for it. It was long and spicy. The sherry finally made itself fully present and does not disappoint. The oak also was far more present in the finish than it was in the rest of the dram. The cinnamon and vanilla once again brought the bourbon notes. There was also a subtle sweetness of honey plums. I was surprised by the bitterness from tobacco, but I thought it added to the finish. I have to admit I had higher expectations from this when I bought it because I adore the A’bundah. However, this is a very good scotch. It may not had been the sherry bomb that I was expecting, but I thought the bourbon barrels really added to the complexity of this. I think this would be a lot better if it was offered non chill-filtered like the 12. \\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non Chill-Filtered (48% abv) ($40)**\\n\\nColor: amber\\n\\nNose: sherry, raisins, strawberries, grapes\\n\\nTaste: plums, currants, sherry, fruity, honey, floral\\n\\nFinish: cherry, plums, vanilla, grapes, toffee\\n\\nOverall: 88/100\\n\\nThe color is a tad bit lighter than the 16. The nose is much more powerful than the 16. Immediately, I get sherry characteristics of raisins and strawberries. I also got some vanilla. While this nose stronger than the 16, it is far less complex. The nose reminds me a lot of a more low-key version of one of my favorites, Aberlour A’bunadh. In the mouth, the plum that were present in the 16 really stand out. Along with currants and other fruits common in sherry. The honey and floral characteristics from the 16 were also present. The flavor is much stronger than in 16 and the mouthfeel was much more rich and creamy. The finish consisted of cherries and plums. With a vanilla flavor that reminded me of the vanilla in the A’bunadh. There were also strong grape notes with a bit of nutty toffee thrown in there. Overall, I like the NCF slightly better than the 16. It tastes very similar to a water-downed A’bunadh and is much more of the sherry bomb I was expecting with Aberlour. However, it is much more one note than the 16. The bourbon barrels and the extra years really add to the complexity of the 16, but the richness and strength of the flavors from the NCF tips the scales in its favor. Both of these are good scotches worth trying, but the NCF is nearly half the price of the 16 and at least its equal and in my eyes a bit better. I would have this on hand at all times if it were available around me, but I had to get this one from Fine Drams. Still neither matches up to the A’bunadh, which is one of my favorites.\\n',\n",

       " '**Aberlour 16, Speyside, 40% ABV**\\n\\nThis was a birthday present bottle from the rents earlier this year—they asked me what single malts I liked the most, I told them Aberlour and Old Pulteney, and this was the wonderful gift that resulted. I made it last for several months, and only just now got around to draining the bottle. While I make clear my disappointments in the review, it should be noted that I am probably harsher on this bottle because I hold the rest of Aberlour’s range—and the 12 non-chill filtered and A’bunadh especially—in very high esteem, and while the 16 is a perfectly fine bottle on its own merits, when put in the context of the rest of Aberlour’s core range, it suffers just a bit.\\n\\nThis is also one year to the date from my first review—of Old Pulteney Navigator—in addition to being my sixtieth review. I also get to visit Aberlour (along with Glenfarclas and Glen Grant) in a few weeks on vacation and I can’t wait. I’ll have reviews at the ready for y’all afterwards!\\n\\n**Nose:** All sorts of sherried goodness here—figs, dates, plums, and blackberries, all blanketed in a slight brown sugar scent to give it a fruit cobbler or cake feel. Very Aberlour, and very, very good.\\n\\n**Body:** Bottles like this one are why I include body in my reviews, as opposed to just remarking on the ABV. On the one hand, bottling a 16-year-old single malt at 40% is borderline criminal. On the other hand, this is full enough and lush enough that Aberlour can almost get away with it. Almost.\\n\\n**Palate:** There’s a vein of saltiness that cuts through this that I haven’t experienced with the 12 or 12 NCF from Aberlour. I’d like to think that if I were nosing this one blind, I could identify it as Aberlour, but this palate would definitely throw me. It’s not a bad quality at all, just unexpected. The fruitiness remains and is really quite outstanding, making for an excellent palate.\\n\\n**Finish:** There is disappointingly not much of one. A bit of heat and pepper, and some of the dark, curranty fruits from the nose, and then it fades immediately in the mouth. Keeps me from rating it higher, which is unfortunate, because the nose and palate are genuinely fantastic.\\n\\n**Price:** USD $70 at Total Wine. A bit overpriced, I think. I can get the A’bunadh for the same price, or the 12 NCF for ten bucks less, and both I would rate higher than the 16. It’s good and definitely worth trying, but I feel like from a quality perspective, it should be a few bucks cheaper, which is unfortunate, because I feel like bang-for-buck is something that Aberlour normally does extremely well.\\n\\n**If it were a soccer (er, football…) club:** Belgium’s 2014 World Cup squad. Belgium needed extra time to beat an overmatched US squad in the round of sixteen before crashing out in the quarterfinals, and though as a team it had a context of real quality, and some truly superlative parts to it, you still come away thinking that it could have and should have been just a little bit better. That’s exactly how I felt about Aberlour 16. It’s plenty good, but it’s just not quite where it can be.\\n\\n**Overall:** I think many distilleries’ second-level aged statement (that is, the one next-oldest from its youngest age statement) tend to be a bit milder than its younger sibling. I get why that’s the case with my beloved Aberlour, but I’m not sure it’s what they do best. 86/100',\n",

This is basically the Aberlour 12 Double Cask with an extra four years on it (please correct me if I'm wrong). Whereas the Aberlour 12 NCF is a fully sherry-matured whisky on top of the non chill filtration, this Aberlour benefits from age and a bit of time in ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. It's tannic, spicy, but still sweet and always complex. There's a pretty noticeable alcoholic bite to this whisky which is surprising as it's 43%; it's not nearly as bad as the 12 Double Cask or other low-end sherried malts. Also, it's creamy and buttery like a Chardonnay. I'm really enjoying this despite a few blemishes, and I honestly didn't think I would because I think the standard 12 is garbage. \\n\\n____________________________________________________________________\\n\\n**Related Reviews**\\n\\n- [Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured, 78/100](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1g0d3g/review_no_14_aberlour_12_sherry_is_as_sherry_does/)\\n- [Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered, 80/100](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1kga6l/review_no_48_aberlour_12_non_chill_filtered_the/)\\n- [Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #32, 96/100](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1kkzw0/battle_royale_reviews_no_49_50_macallan_cask/)\\n\\n\\n*Scotch whisky review #91*\\n\\n*Whisky reviews #118*\",\n",

It's only 40% unfortunately and is aged similar to the 12 year in ex-bourbon and sherry casks. It retails quite modestly at $90 though so maybe it’s a hidden bargain?\\n\\n* Color: Light amber\\n* Nose: Sherry, orchard fruits, stewed berries, raisins, treenuts\\n* Taste: Spicy oak, sherry, strawberry, cherry, raspberry, light clove, nuts, slight tannin note\\n* Finish: Medium with strawberry and treenuts\\n\\nIn the end it was actually really nice for an 80 proof single malt. Tasted like a 43% which is quite good, it’s a very nice step up from the 12 year and while there are better bottles out there it could still work as a good buy for an inexperienced drinker who wants a dip into older vintage whisky.\\n\\n**Final Score: 82/100**\\n\",\n",

Not shockingly, sherry showed up in all three segments (nose/palate/finish) most likely because it was so different and new that it really stood out. Because the sherry was at the forefront I might have missed some of the more nuanced flavors, but it seemed very complex while staying easy to drink. Flavors mixed dark fruit and sweetness well, with everything pulled together nicely with a little woodiness. I now know what a sherried scotch is and also now know that I like them! I'd definitely buy a bottle of this in the future to spend some more time with.\",\n",
       " \"Well, since I missed the boat on the A’bunadh community review, I figured I’d add a bit of contrast to the mix, and review the Aberlour 16 year old.  Speyside single malt.  43% abv, and $67 USD.  Matured in ex-bourbon and then sherry casks, which explains the absolutely beautiful deep amber color.  I literally stared at the glass for several minutes before even bringing it to my nose.\\n\\nColor: Amber +1  \\n\\nNose: I found the nose to be floral, with dried fruit.  Raisins, honey.  Sherry, and fresh cut wood. \\n\\nPalate:  Although only 43%, I found the initial taste to be just a little hot when tasted neat.  Upon adding a few drops of water, however, and let to sit another ten minutes, I found the taste to really open up.  The palate definitely has more notes of spice and pepper up front than the nose would imply, but all of the descriptions of the nose are still evident as it lingers in the mouth.  Mouth feel is very slightly oily and viscous.  I prefer a creamier feel, but with a whisky this nice, that’s hardly taking points away from the overall review.  With the addition of only a few drops of water, this whisky becomes incredibly smooth and delicious.  Very easy to drink.\\n\\nFinish:  The finish is medium in length, and I find it to be a nice balance between the spice and the fruit, and then wood.  \\n\\nBottom Line: I highly recommend this whisky.  It is sweeter and less spicy and peppery than the A’bunadh, which I found to be more complex and flavorful, but I’d say that this 16  year is more ‘drinkable’.  In fact, beware of a rapidly disappearing bottle.  This stuff is fantastic.\\n\\nCheers.  \\n\\n\\n\\nEdit:  I just read another review and someone said that this has caramel added for color.

Or a single malt to drink around the poker table - enough flavor and balance to  enjoy while doing something else but not so complex that you have to attend to it 100% to truly appreciate. Yum. For about US$10 more where I am, you can pick up the A'bunadh, though, which is easily a better value - deeper, more intense and more complex. Still, a good one to have around in the liquor cabinet (or dining room or game room).\",\n",
       " \"While I was out this afternoon looking at a bottle to pick up as something extra for my Scotchswap Secret Santa, I came across this bottle at an extremely reasonable price - $60, while every other place I’ve seen has had it at $65+. I found it quite hard to pass up at that price.\\n\\nThis is a Highland Single Malt, which gets a sherry finish after aging in first fill Bourbon casks. \\n\\n**Nose:** Both the Bourbon and Sherry casks stand out here. The bourbon seems especially strong, with what I can only describe as bourbon - vanilla and cinnamon, mostly - but transitions nicely to a sweet, sherry fruit. Some cherry, but mostly more mellow fruits.\\n\\n**Palate:** The bourbon influence seems to be lacking here, just sweet fruit and tea, going into a slight tobacco into the finish.Some floral, almost leafy notes. \\n\\n**Finish:** Now that’s where the vanilla and cinnamon went to. A reasonably long finish that has a ton of influence from the bourbon. Its also quite spicy on the finish. \\n\\n**Overall:** Quite a fine scotch, but not something I would be broken up about to find out they were discontinuing. Its something I would gladly pull out for a visitor or someone trying to broaden their scope of the scotch world, but not one to go out of your way to find.\\n\\n**Rating: (Very Good) - 86**\\n\\nAs an comparison, I would rank this very similarly to the Balvenie 14 Caribbean cask, especially since they're at the same price point for me. Good, solid scotch that are well worth trying, but nothing to start trying to chase down.\",\n",
       " '**Introductory Comments**:  Today I\\'ll be reviewing Aberlour 16, which sits in the [middle](https://www.aberlour.com/en-US/our-whisky) of Aberlour\\'s core lineup.  Previously I reviewed batch 61 of their famous [A\\'bunadh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/8e34zr/review_13_aberlour_abunadh_batch_61/), which I enjoyed, but in retrospect I feel I may have rated a bit too high.  Either way, this was my first taste of one of Aberlour\\'s aged expressions.  Aged in a combination of ex-bourbon casks and Oloroso butts for 16 years, but diluted down to 40% and probably chill-filtered, I went into this bottle expecting a soft and pleasant set of flavors, but not expecting to be blown away.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Aberlour 16** (40% ABV, chill-filtered, E150 added, aged for 16 years in American oak casks and sherry-seasoned casks)\\n\\n* **Nose**:  Mild aromas of dark, dried fruits, cherries, grapes, fresh apples, baking spices, citrus, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of ethanol \\n* **Palate**:   Sweet vanilla and spicy oak, raisins, figs, pepper, nutmeg, and clove; mild but well-balanced with a thin mouthfeel and a bit astringent\\n* **Finish**:  Oak, cherries, pepper, and a bit of ethanol initially, with lingering notes  of raisin, apple, dark chocolate, and nuts; short finish\\n\\n**Score**:  81/100\\n\\n**Comments**:  No surprises here, but also nothing particularly impressive.  The distillery has done a good job of putting together a well-balanced, easy-to-drink whisky that delivers a pretty standard set of ex-bourbon and Oloroso notes.  Despite being 40% ABV, it is a touch astringent and hot towards the finish, which is a paradoxical flaw that several diluted single malts exhibit.  But it\\'s not so hot that it seriously detracts from the drinkability of this whisky.\\n\\nWhere the 40% ABV and chill-filtration really hurts this whisky is how it neuters it and restrains its aromas and flavors.  While it\\'s an easy drinker, it\\'s not a memorable drinker, and for how much Aberlour 16 costs, that\\'s a price point at which I\\'m expecting more than just an easy drinker.  This is a solid whisky, but there\\'s so many options in the sherry-matured space that offer what Aberlour 16 offers for half the price, that I just don\\'t see the value here.\\n\\nI\\'m curious to hear people\\'s opinions on the 12 and 18 compared to the 16.  I\\'d like to try the 12, but it\\'s tough to get inspired after tasting the 16.  On the other hand, perhaps the 18 is worth trying, given its \"deeper sherry influence\" and 43% ABV compared to 40%.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scoring & Recommendation Guide**:  Assigning a rating to a whisky is a subjective and imperfect process.  I have adapted the 100 point, American-style grading scale mainly because that\\'s what most of the entries in the whisky review archive use.  I tend to write a lot about the whiskies I review, beyond just a list of tasting notes and a score, because I think that\\'s where most of the value in a review is to be found.  But here are my scoring statistics thus far.  I regard 90 and above as being great and something I would happily buy again, while 50 and below is undrinkable.\\n\\n* *# of Reviews*:  52\\n* *Mean*:  78.9\\n* *Std Dev*:  12.7\\n* *Median*:  82.5\\n* *Min*:  [33](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/9gbyak/reviews_30_31_monarch_of_the_glen_3_year_and_8/)\\n* *Max*:  [94](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/arnuz9/reviews_4850_a_glendronach_vertical_featuring_the/)',\n",

As I write, I\\'ve been getting more aggressive with adding water because the finish is kinda falling apart on me.

       " 'Happy Mother’s Day, Scotchit! Thank you to u/DangerousDoorknob for this dram!\\n\\nIt’s not particularly common to see Aberlour in anything other than sherry casks. Of course, the madmen at SMWS have gone and stuck some into a Nicaraguan rum cask, which I have been informed is likely from Flor de Cana. Let’s check it out!\\n\\nAlso, my man u/zSolaris poured this whisky at the same time as I did, so keep an eye out for his upcoming review!\\n\\n***\\n\\t\\n**Aberlour 16 2002 SMWS 54.78 “Sugarcane flowers in Speyside”.** Speyside single malt. 60.4% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Maturation:** Distilled February 10th 2002, bottled at 16 years old. Initially matured in a bourbon barrel, then finished in a refill Nicaraguan rum barrel. Bottled at cask strength, yielding 149 bottles total.\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 15 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Colour:** Light gold.\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet and fragrant. Lots of, uh, cane sugar. Makes sense! Reminds me of a cane-sugar cola I had yesterday. Banana split (vanilla ice cream, bananas, caramel, and fudge sauce). Samoas, ginger beer, graham crackers, banana pudding, lemon custard, and bundt cake. A whole greenhouse full of tropical flowers, maybe with a bit of rosewater.\\n\\nWater adds more honey and a bit of a greener side to the flowers, almost mojito-like. \\n\\n**Palate:** Thick texture, moderate heat. Loads of candied ginger, Bananas Foster, and tropical flowers on the arrival. Bittersweet sugar cane and caramel fudge. Very sweet, sticky development. Piles of manuka honey, beeswax, and date squares, then rich vanilla. Some zingy lemon and fresh ginger. Mouth-tingling candied pineapple, citrus zest, chocolate-covered macadamias, and more cola. \\n\\nWith water, there’s a more mellow tropical side to this dram. Some guava and soft mint.\\n\\n**Finish:** Long and honeyed. Dripping honeycomb, chewy tropical fruit, vanilla, candied ginger, hibiscus, and almonds. Exotic spices, a kick of ginger, and chili-spiced chocolate. A hint of mint.\\n\\nThe water doesn’t kill the length on the finish, which is nice. Fresh summer watermelon, sugared grapefruit, and more mint.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Possible SMWS bottling name: “Bumblebees by the Keys”**\\n\\n**Notes:** I love a good honey-bomb, and this whisky delivers the goods. The honey comes through so strongly, on the development and especially the finish. The dram walks the line between being refreshingly fruity and light and being richly dessert-y and dense. Lovely floral notes without being too perfumy or green. I couldn’t stop thinking about that cane-sugar craft cola I had yesterday. The rum cask isn’t very funky at all, which isn’t really a criticism, just something to keep in mind if you’re looking for something very rummy. Also, if you don’t have the huge sweet tooth that I do, steer clear!\\n\\n**Final score: 88/100** \\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. \\n\\n60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but it can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good. Quality stuff.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout dram.\\n\\n90-94: Personal favourite.\\n\\n95-100: Mythical.

       " 'Speyside, 60.4%. Cask strength, natural color, and non-chillfiltered. An unusual Aberlour here, a rum cask finish rather than their typical sherry. I’m not usually the biggest fan of rum casks, but was intrigued by this. Reviewed from a sample. Rested about 15 minutes. \\n\\n* Color: [0.4 jonquil](https://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)   \\n\\n* Nose: Alcohol is pretty strong. Cotton candy, banana bordering on overripe, white chocolate, mascarpone. \\n\\n* Palate: Oh, that’s more like it. The nose was a little strange, but the palate is good. Pineapple, cream soda, jawbreakers, lime. Definitely an artificially-flavored fruit candy taste, but it works. Serious heat. This will need some water. Does calm down with water, and the lime is stronger as well. \\n\\n* Finish: Oozing fruit again, on the verge of overripe. Soda. Lime sorbet. Sugarcane (as advertised I suppose). \\n\\nConclusion: Rum casks haven’t often worked too well for me, but this one does. The lime soda/sorbet flavor helps a lot and prevents the sweetness and overripe flavor from taking over. I wouldn’t say it’s balanced exactly; it’s big and not subtle at all. Improves with water to my taste. Good stuff and it’s definitely different. \\n\\nBuy a bottle? Unlikely to come across it but I’d consider it.  \\n\\n**7**\\n\\n0 - Spit it out  \\n1 - Vile, only drinkable in a cocktail: Muirhead’s Silver Seal 16  \\n2 - Bad, would not drink neat: Johnnie Walker Red  \\n3 - Poor, some serious flaws: Old Pulteney 12  \\n4 - Marginal, would drink but not buy: Glenmorangie 10  \\n5 - Decent, nothing special: Aultmore 12  \\n6 - Good, an enjoyable drink: Glen Scotia 15  \\n7 - Very good, a step up: Tomatin 18  \\n8 - Special, a real pleasure: Ledaig 13 Amontillado  \\n9 - Incredible, one of the best I’ve had: Bruichladdich Black Art 4.1  \\n10 - Perfect, cannot imagine better: Convalmore 36',\n",

It isn\\'t quite \"I feel like I\\'m biting into a honeycomb\" levels of honey, but it\\'s just short of that. There\\'s also something that is somewhere between crystallized honey and raw sugar. It reminds me of [kkul-tarae (꿀타래) / Dragon\\'s Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkul-tarae). Popping fruit jellies come in afterwards in tropical fruit flavorings. Being north of 60% ABV, it does come with a bit of heat but a few drops of water cools it down very nicely without any loss of flavor.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium in length. A darker sugar (perhaps turbinado?) comes through strongly. A bit of vanilla and crystallized honey are present as well. There is a little bit of a firey note that I seem to get every so often in a rum cask whisky, I\\'ve not quite placed a finger on it.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Conclusion:** SMWS\\' naming scheme can be a bit wonky but they\\'ve got this one nailed down fairly nicely this time. This Aberlour is chock full of sugary notes with raw sugar, kkul-tarae/Dragon\\'s Beard candy, and crystallized honey being front and center. The little bit of floral notes in the nose and the bit of tropical fruit in the palate keep things from being too one dimensional. All and all, a really fun and tasty whisky. Would I buy a bottle?

Beautifully well rounded on the palate, balanced toffee sweetness and rich but then an explosion of fruit. You can tell there's been real craftsmanship going into this spirit, the quality is superb. There's even a lot going on in the finish with this wonderful mix of sweet and sour. The sweetness isn't overbearing or too saccharine, it's a savoury sort of tangy, bittersweet taste which keeps changing on the tongue. You're glowing from a sip of this long after you've drank it down.

Once I start looking for smoke because the label says I’m supposed to I get a faint hint of tar. Quite sweet and fruity. Pleasant, but not lots of depth here.\\n\\n**Taste** - Starts on honeyed vanilla crème, developing in to some berry flavors with plenty of ginger, some clove, black pepper, a touch of smoke, and allspice. Again, quite nice, but not tons of richness or depth here. Smoke is better integrated than with some other Speysides I’ve had (Ardmore Traditional Cask).\\n\\n**Finish** - Honey, a tangy berry note, clove, and ginger with some black pepper lingering.\\n\\nI quite enjoy this, but there’s nothing here that really knocks my socks off that would put the score in to the 90's. It has the right nice, sweet, easy, approachable Speyside flavors, the way a Glenfarclas or Balvenie does – Glenfarclas 17 being what this reminds me of the most. I did think it was interesting tasting an Aberlour with the sherry influence dialed back a bit from the power that the A’Bunadh, or most other Aberlour offerings, bring to the table, likely due to the refill sherry (I think) cask in this case – although this one is certainly still sherried.\\n\\n**88**/100\\n\\nEdit: distilled ON 5/7/1990, not in 5/7/1990.\",\n",

Bold and rich yet dry, musty and fruity, I like this nose.\\n\\n**Taste:** A little more lively than the nose suggests. Opens with fruity malt that has a tart, jazzy kick. It opens up into rich, creamy caramel and a friendly berry fruitiness. Thick mouthfeel while having a nimble kind of flavor that isn\\'t overbearing, very nice.\\n\\n**Finish:** Rich caramel with a tasty zing like blueberry syrup that isn\\'t huge or completely mouth-coating, but it rides out and slowly fades nicely, still enjoyable.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nThis is a beautiful Scotch, very elegant and rich yet retains a lot of fun flavors. It is thick and full flavored while never feeling too heavy or monotone. I tend to like younger whiskies and I feel like this is aged to perfection in the 16-18 range, and hasn\\'t gotten too old or \"smooth\" yet.

It\\'s also really off-character for Aberlour, even if you try to discount the lack of sherry casks involved. \\n\\nThis is, though, one of the reasons I love IB single casks.

It was not as overpoweringly or sickeningly sweet as I tend to find Highland malts.  The herbal notes were subtle and complemented the delicate creamy floral notes.

       " \"**Intro:** I like Aberlour. In my limited experience they're my favorite of the Speyside sherrybombs. I bought several of their 12 Double Cask before they knocked the ABV to 40% and the price rose by $10. I always thought their stronger stuff was superior, but I had never tried their more mature offerings. So why not a back-to-back? Why not, indeed.  \\n\\n\\n\\n______________  \\n\\n\\n\\n**This is:** Aberlour 16.  \\n\\n\\n**43% ABV** was my offering, but it looks like it's gone down to 40%.  \\n\\n\\n\\n**color:** *Gourmet honey with tears...*  \\n\\n\\n**nose:** *Floral & oaky...* lavender, rose, red grape, dusty oak, and mint.  \\n\\n\\n**taste:** *Very smooth & sweet...* caramel, butterscotch, and honey.  \\n\\n\\n**finish:** *Dried fruit & oak...* raisins, dried mango, peach, pomegranate, and lingering mesquite and oak.  \\n\\n\\n**conclusions:** Not as juicy-fruity as the younger offerings, but very well aged. I also didn't catch the menthol-like whiff of smoke in its younger brothers. It's funny, despite the give-and-take differences, Aberlours always wind up rated around the same for me. Which is to say, high!  \\n\\n**92/100**  \\n\\n\\n\\n_______________ \\n\\n\\n\\n**This is:** Aberlour 18.  \\n\\n\\n**43% ABV** for me at least!  \\n\\n\\n**color:** *Darkish amber...*  \\n\\n\\n**nose:** *Very light...* peach, lavender, and oak.  \\n\\n\\n**taste:** *Rich & sweet...* peanut brittle, candy apple, butterscotch ice cream, and Whoppers. Almost chewable!  \\n\\n\\n**finish:** *Sweet & oaky...* honey, raisins, malt, vanilla, brown sugar, cream, with big oak and almond. Fades a bit too quickly.  \\n\\n\\n**conclusions:** What a mouth feel! Succulent. Unfortunately the finish isn't quite as big as I would want, with none of the big flavors sticking around. And, honestly, *where is the sherry?!* Yes, there is unmistakable raisin-sherry notes in the finish, but this isn't the bomb of even the 12 Double Cask. Rather un-Aberlour, this is. But it is also, very rich and very, very good.  \\n\\n**94/100**  \\n\\n\\n\\n____________  \\n\\n\\n\\n*Comparyvreckans:*  \\n\\nAberlour 12 Double Cask (43%) -- 88/100  \\n\\nAberlour 12 Non-Chill Filtered -- 91/100  \\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh batch #33 -- 89/100\",\n",

Odd orange citrus and leather.\\n\\n**Taste:**   Thin, sharp, hot and acidic. The sherry is apparent here but it's nothing like the nose. The deep complexity isn't present and it's like a sweet acidic sticky mess. Lots of fig, cocoa, raspberry syrup\\n\\n**Finish:**  Medium to short, hot, sulphuric and really quite abrubt. There's little sherry notes to speak of.\\n\\n**Overall:** I'm surprised and a little sad to comment on how quickly this dram went downhill. I enjoyed the nose immensely and then all of that pleasure just wisped away. I've not yet found many drams that seem to have sherry sulphur in them but this is an overload, almost to the point of washing out all of the other notes. For an expensive, old bottle, this isn't particularly great. There's some redeeming quality in the nose - I could sit and smell it all day but I'd save the actual consumption for another dram that can follow through.

       " 'Hello Scotchit, was sitting home watching a bunch of loser morons run some race in Boston yesterday so I decided to do something productive and drink/review some whisky, Aberlour 18.\\n\\n**Color:** See picture, if there’s color added it’s minimal.\\n\\n**Nose:** Bitter orange, hint of cask muskiness, coffee, a strong blast of dark chocolate, prunes, some nice hints of tropical fruit (apricot and banana), had a distinct minty-ness right after I opened the bottle that faded over time. \\n\\n**Taste:** Some bitter oak, leather, definitely not a sherry bomb, the sherry is restrained and plays nicely with the age. There’s a bit of a perfumey quality that is a bit “artificial” tasting but it fades after some time in the glass with a bit of water.   \\n\\n**Finish:** Big blast of peach, drying oak, very creamy and surprisingly long for how mellow the nose and palate are. Some nice baking spices (nutmeg and cinnamon). The European oak influence is apparent. Oranges and chocolate linger pleasantly.\\n\\n**Score: 86**\\n\\n**Conclusions:** I had this on a Whisky Guild scotch cruise a couple years back and remember it being a lot more sherried. I finally bought a bottle and was initially a bit disappointed. The sherry influence is restrained and I was in a bit of a sherry monster phase at the time. As I drank more of it I began to appreciate this for what it is: a nice, mature whisky that happened to have been aged in (probably refill) sherry casks. This isn’t the greatest booze in the world or anything but it’s super tasty and not a bad deal at 80$ for an 18 year old and I’d take a glass anytime. \\n',\n",

Lovely sweet citrusy notes of lemon and pomelo greeted me initially while grassy notes built with time: wheatgrass, clover, and hints of dried hay. Creme brûlée came to mind with caramelized sugars and nougat before grainy notes appeared as the dram settled with honey butter cornbread and cornmeal. \\n \\n**Palate** : Medium to light bodied with citrus fruits, grass, and floral notes. Citrus fruits at first with hints of cream, dried florals, and refined sugar. A grassy sweetness built with time as sugar cane, wheatgrass, and all sorts of young cereal grain shoots came to mind. Grassy notes continued toward the end and brought to mind sweetened matcha tea or matcha pastries.  \\n\\n**Finish** : Lingering notes of cream, matcha, and citrus with mild astringency.  \\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Score** : 6  \\n\\n**Mental Image** : Matcha Pastry Shop Milkshake  \\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Notes** :  There was once a really interesting matcha bakery that my wife and I visited a few times that had matcha and soy everything. It was a bit of a gimmick, but I thought their matcha milkshake (which I believe was also vegan, though I was focused on the milkshake part, so maybe I have misremembered) was lovely. It was good enough that I made a point of going back and getting it again and this Aberlour reminded me a bit of that experience.  \\n\\nI found this mellow Aberlour fascinating in its evolution. The flavor profile featured some of the same grass, grain, and cream notes as the nose, but with an added blast of sweet citrus up front and a greater depth of earthy notes. Aberlour is not a distillery I am usually on the lookout to try. The only one I recall being particularly striking was an ex-rum bottle from SMWS. The grassy quality of the spirit is not my favorite, and sherry-driven Aberlour have never tickled my fancy.    \\n\\nI enjoyed the intriguing transition that this Aberlour seemed to undergo as it continued to open up. The creaminess was nice, though occasionally, it hit as a slightly sour twang toward the end. I can definitely imagine that note is not one everyone will enjoy though I did not always find it. There were moments with some of the floral and citrus notes that reminded me of laundry detergent, especially on the nose. I  had this same impression with Aberlour previously, so the distillery will likely remain off my radar for the most part.',\n",
       " \"Reviewed from a pour at Boyd's Jig and Reel in Knoxville, TN. This is 52.8% at cask strength. My girlfriend and I were splitting these samples as we usually do, and amusingly this one was distilled the year she was born and bottled the year she graduated high school. Not why we ordered it, but amusing anyway. This is the first IB Aberlour I've had, I'm pretty sure.

Once things went online during the pandemic I wasn't sure when I'd get back to trying some crazy scotches.\\nThen I get a message from my pal /u/the_muskox about an online tasting involving some old dusty Scott's Selection bottlings and immediately I was all in. I hadn't tried anything from this bottler since my birthday back in 2019 (BEFORE THE DARK TIMES!) so I was very excited to try some more.\\n\\nFor those who haven't heard of this bottler, Scott's Selection is an independent bottler that released occasional bottlings from the 80s until the early 2000s and was a bit of an interesting case as it was a boutique-style of IB founded by Robert Scott, the former master blender at Speyside Distillers. Robert used this IB label to release a parcel of casks that he really enjoyed.\\nRobert's Port Ellen I tried was very very good so I'm excited to see what will be in store today! Let's get to it!\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Pulteney 27 Year 1977 Scott's Selection**\\n\\nI have not had a proper indie bottling on Old Pulteney in a while, much less one over 20 years old and from the 1970s to boot!

Its like if Clynelish, Mortlach and Tomatin had a baby that was delicate, rich, waxy and honeyed. Its super multilayered but most importantly its easy to drink and viscous. I'd be surprised if anything tops this whisky for me in 2021. This is STUNNING!\\n\\n**92/100**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Caol Ila 21 Year 1984 Scott's Selection**\\n\\nSpeaking of stunning, 80s Caol Ila is definitely a benchmark for stunning old Islay whiskies.

Really phenomenal stuff indeed!\\n\\n**89/100**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Aberlour 17 Year 1989 Scott's Selection**\\n\\nNow onto a distillery I haven't reviewed in maybe 3-4 years. Aberlour is a bit of a poster child of typical, normal Speyside scotch and bourbon cask Aberlour is something that I've seen mixed reactions of. So let's see if the age helps shine this distillery better.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Age: 17 Years**\\n\\n**Region: Speyside**\\n\\n**Cask Type(s): Oak**\\n\\n**ABV: 52.8%** \\n\\n**No. of Bottles: Not Available**\\n\\n**Maturation Time: 1989/2007**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n* Colour: Pale Gold\\n\\n* Nose: Fresh flowers, baking flour, kosher salt, cereal sugars, cocoa powder, fresh cut grass, apple peel and dry caramels\\n\\n* Palate: Sweet apple cider, white pepper, baking spices, pear slices, brown sugar and butter\\n\\n* Finish: Medium with browning butter, cocoa and apple jelly\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nQuite a dry nose but the palate is quite sweet and Autumn-inspired, much like the Caol Ila 1984. Very apple-y and spicy with great cereal sweetness and cocoa makes it a fun little dram, if a bit simple and typical of a bourbon cask Speyside.\\nNot quite my preferred profile but the spirit purity and light oiliness help it a lot.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Bunnahabhain 15 Year 1988 Scott's Selection**\\n\\nNow onto possibly my favourite Islay distillery as of late (not including Port Ellen in this situation.) This is the youngest whisky of the lineup at 15 years old and is likely from a 2nd or 3rd fill bourbon barrel or hogshead. Let's see how a more spirit driven Bunna tastes from this period.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**Age: 15 Years**\\n\\n**Region: Islay**\\n\\n**Cask Type(s): Oak**\\n\\n**ABV: 53.8%** \\n\\n**No. of Bottles: Not Available**\\n\\n**Maturation Time: 1988/2004**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n* Colour: Straw Gold\\n\\n* Nose: Sweet barley, vanilla, citrus peel, cinnamon, clove, dried apple, sea salt, dry pebbles and white pepper\\n\\n* Palate: Sweet bread, vanilla, lemon peel, white chocolate, ginger snaps, oiliness, brine and sea salt\\n\\n* Finish: Medium with pan au chocolat, cinnamon, ginger and clove spicess\\n \\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nQuite complex and spice heavy with some great cocoa sweetness.

       " 'Scotchtoberfest’s greetings, Scotchit! Thank you very much to u/FederalAgents for this dram!\\n\\nThis is another of those dusty Scott’s Selection bottlings that a bunch of us nerds tried on a Zoom call together. Aberlour isn’t seen naked, meaning without maturation in a strong cask, all too often. The cask type for this release isn’t specified, but given the light colour, it’s likely a refill ex-bourbon cask, offering a rare peek behind the curtain at how Aberlour’s spirit handles 18 years in an inactive cask.\\n\\n***\\n\\t\\t\\n**Aberlour 18 1989 Scott’s Selection.** Speyside single malt. 52.8% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Maturation:** Distilled 1989, bottled 2007 at 18 years old. Matured in an oak cask (very descriptive, Mr. Scott). Bottled at cask strength. \\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in a glencairn. Rested about 20 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Nose:** Very light and clean, with an effervescent quality. Soft notes of white flowers and sweet mint sit on top, then nougat, malt, white chocolate, and creamy vanilla underneath. Citrus oils, Asian pear, some candied pineapple, and tamarind. Carbonated mineral water… oh, it’s that orange-flavoured Perrier! A hint of leather. \\n\\n**Palate:** Medium-light texture, effervescent. Perfumed and cool on the arrival. There’s some cucumber, melon, green berries, as well as more of those flowers and orange oils. Then it’s unexpectedly beeswaxy, along with soft vanilla and more of a tropical twist to the fruit. Soft oak comes in towards the back, with cool herbs and grass, tempered by gentle honey and marshmallow.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-long. Black tea and soft leather. More green fruit - cucumber, honeydew, kiwi, tamarind chutney (not green, I know) and lemongrass. There’s the zing of tangy pickled ginger and seltzer. Light malt. I forget who it was who came up with this, but there’s a bit of an asparagus note here.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Possible SMWS bottling name: “Midnight garden walk in sparkling silk pyjamas”**\\n\\n**Notes:** A delicate drop, but a very, very tasty one. It’s not dissimilar to the rum-cask SMWS Aberlour I tried a few months ago, but stripped back to its barest essentials. It still has that lovely tropical and honeyed character, but where the SMWS had rich sweetness, this Scott’s has effervescence and cool flowers. That fizziness came through more in my second pour of this whisky, and was really delightful.\\n\\n**Final score: 87/100** \\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. \\n\\n60-69: Not so good. I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but it can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Decent whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Quite good. Quality stuff.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout dram.\\n\\n90-94: Delicious. Personal favourite. \\n\\n95-100: Mythical. I don’t know if I’ll ever taste a whisky this good.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAverage rating: 81.5\\n\\n*My rating scale is based purely on flavour experience, and does not take value-for-money or willingness to purchase a bottle into account.

       " \"This lovely bottle of Aberlour carries a 19 year age statement and is a special, presumably multi-cask bottling for The Whisky Trail. If indeed this bottle is from more than one cask, I'd guess most of the wood was ex-bourbon, probably refill. That makes this a fun dram, because usually Aberlour distillery bottlings tend to emphasize sherry casks more heavily. This presentation, however, lets the spirit show through. What a fine spirit it is too!\\n\\n**Aberlour 1992-2012 Berry's**\\n\\n**Color:** Amber -1\\n\\n**ABV:** 55.5%\\n\\n**Aroma Neat:**\\n\\nLight Tupelo Honey, Beeswax, Buttery Mineral Chardonnay, Fresh Bananas, Barley Malt, Golden Delicious Apples, Lemon Oil, Shortbread Cookies.\\n\\nMalty and honeyed with dry white wine. Waxy too. Tastes like yellow!\\n\\n**Aroma Water:**\\n\\nHoneyed White Tea, Toffee, Toasted Malt, Golden and Green Apples, Lemon Oil, Dusty Oak, Antique Varnish, Vanilla Bean (faintly), White Peaches (slightly).\\n\\nSweeter than neat, but more structured.\\n \\n**Taste Neat:**\\n\\nBeeswax, Tart Malt, Barley Flour, Pithy Lemon, Resinous Oak, Mineral Water (lots!), Bitter Green Grapes, Aloe Vera (vegetal notes).\\n\\nWaxy on dry as a bone on the palate. This is very much malt whisky which isn't obscured by the wood it was matured in, despite the lengthy maturation period. Tastes like it's from an earlier, less wood-centric era of whisky making.\\n\\n\\n**Taste Water:**\\n\\nHoney, Buttery Chardonnay, Waxy Apples, Dry Oak, Bitter Char/Ash, Banana Malt (look it up :-) ), Lemon Pith, Chalk Dust, Sour Cherries (great surprise!), Aloe.\\n\\nSweeter than neat, like the nose, though still very much on the dry side of the malt whisky spectrum.\\n\\n**Finish:**\\n\\nWax, Ashy Charcoal, Dry Tannic Oak, Mineral Water (with a touch of honey), Burned Barley Malt.\\n\\nTears the all the saliva off from your tongue, leaving burnt and mineral traces behind. You're forced to take another sip. This works for me, since I like dry whiskies.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nWelcoming nose with excellent balance.\\n\\nChallenging, old-school palate. Becomes more accessible with water, which brings out a bit of malty and honeyed sweetness.\\n\\nWaxy and bitter finish that lasts and lasts.\\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100\\n\\nI like austere drams, so this is very much in my wheelhouse. If you are accustomed to sweeter whiskies, maybe sherry monsters or bourbons, this may be a shock to you.\\n\\nA special thanks to my wonderful Aunt, who brought this bottle back to me as a gift from Scotland.

       " \"A little preamble:\\n\\nIt is my birthday. Today actually. \\n\\nMy plan for a while was to get myself a bottle of scotch that was distilled in 1988, the year I was born, for my birthday.

       " \"**#151 - Aberlour 25y c1995 Old Particular “K&L Wine Exclusive”**\\n\\n****\\n\\n* 58.4% abV\\n* 25 years old, matured in a single refill hogshead #DL14246\\n* Distilled in May 1995, bottled in August 2020\\n* Non-Chill Filtered\\n* Natural Color\\n* 2oz sample\\n\\n****\\n\\nThis sample is a bit of a rarity as I don’t think I’ve ever seen an independent bottling of Aberlour. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an OB of Aberlour this old either. The oldest OB I’ve seen has been their 18y, which I thoroughly enjoyed a bottle of about 3 years ago. This cask comes from a hogshead and just on color alone it appears to be a departure from the house style heavy Sherry cask influence. This was the primary reason I really wanted to try this bottling. I don’t know for sure if this refill hogshead was previously seasoned with Sherry, or more likely a repurposed Bourbon barrel, but either way I’m hoping for a less Sherry driven experience than a typical Aberlour. \\n\\n****\\n\\n**Nose:** Tropical fruits galore like papaya, peach, and pineapple, beeswax, rich maltiness, some oak and toasted coconut notes. Spiced caramel comes out with time, some brown sugar too. The addition of water really mutes the nose all around but brings out more caramel and rich toffee flavors. \\n\\n**Taste:** Juicy is the first word that comes to mind. Lots of fruits like red apple, peach and guava. Rich maltiness, some vanilla and coconut again, also some heat. Water highlights the fruit and sweet oak notes but does little to deal with the heat. \\n\\n**Finish:** First sweet malt and toffee followed by bitter oak and bitter chocolate. A touch hot. Medium in length. Water prolongs the finish, draws out more on the toffee and oak notes, adds some vanilla frosting flavors, and dampens the heat a little. \\n\\n**81**\\n\\n****\\n\\n00-10 | Jepson’s Malort | Tonight's the night I fight my dad\\n\\n10-19 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out\\n\\n20-29 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice\\n\\n30-39 | Bad | Multiple flaws, not to my tastes, made for mixing\\n\\n40-49 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have\\n\\n50-59 | Average | Drinkable but forgettable, nothing notable or wrong\\n\\n60-69 | Good | Tasty stuff if nothing else\\n\\n70-79 | Great | Very tasty, something to keep on hand\\n\\n80-89 | Excellent | Well above average, memorable and desirable\\n\\n90-95 | Incredible | One of my all time favorite\\n\\n95-100 | Perfect | Nothing better in the category\\n\\n****\\nExcellent and so very different from what I associate with Aberlour. I just recently had the A’bunadh Alba and was expecting perhaps some similarities but there really weren’t any. This was a tropical fruit bomb at first which evolved into a richer toffee and oakier flavor profile. This was what a lot of folks would label a classic Speyside dram. I can agree with that but this also carried some loud flavors and good complexity to help it stand apart from the masses. The biggest knock I have for this is how much the alcohol stood out. After 25 years this still came out of the cask at a relatively high abv. Water did help overall but the alcohol bite was surprisingly always still there. Even despite that, this was excellent and something straight up delicious. $300 is a lot to command for a bottle but I don’t know where one would find an Aberlour of this character and age elsewhere. Fortunate to have tried a sample as I wouldn’t spring for this bottle personally. \\n\\n****\\n\\n**The glass:** In case you were wondering, I found my glass, and others like it, at a flea market in Lima, Peru. If you are ever there, go check out the “Indian Markets” in the Miraflores district to find some glasses like these, among many other styles. They nose very well but are a bit awkward to drink from. I hand wash mine and after years of use have noticed no flaking of the gold/silver paint. Cheers!\",\n",

I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever tried one like this before.  It really lets the spirit shine through, but with the age needed to round it out.  Interestingly, there is no one aspect of this that sticks out.  Its just a really well rounded and tasty whisky.  If somebody asked me, \"What does Scotch taste like\", I think I would point them to this for an unpeated one and some Islay for a peated one.  Its not ground breaking and probably not quite worth the price, but its still very, very good.  Certainly an interesting one to try.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot \\'Aberlour\\'',\n",

Mid to high proof, not CS I don't think, unless it's very old. 50% range I think.

Rich nose. \\n\\n**Palate:** dry rich sherry, dark red fruit, lots of chocolate, tobacco, leather, honey, caramel, molasses, high 40s to low 50s ABV. This has a ton going on. Seems like fully aged in sherry cask.  \\n\\n**Finish:** long, dry, fruity and still that leathery taste. \\n\\n**Score:** 91\\n\\nthis is a fantastic dram. Seems fully aged in **Olorosso** or some other less sweet sherry. I'm going to guess it's a **Glendronach single cask**.

Almost smells like some japanese Shochu I have. \\n\\n**Palate:** light malt, tons of light fruit and berries, light spices, candy-like sweetness, cask strength… likely close to 60%. Lots of oak influence, ex bourbon. Maybe a weird finish like a white wine? I get no peat from this. Some saltiness. \\n\\n**Finish:** long, sweet, pez candy. Really something. Super long run the sweetness dies and just a ton of oak and some bitterness remains. Crazy unique. \\n\\n**Score:** 91\\n\\nI like this a lot, and have literally no idea what it is. It's super sweet which I normally don't care for, but somehow pulls it off in a fantastic way. You stumped me on this one completely /u/devoz.

Smells fantastic. \\n\\n**Palate:** smoky, ashy, but sweet. Damn. This is a beautiful blend of sherry and peat. Tons of dark fruit and berries, along with chocolate, tobacco, coffee, and tons of oak. This tastes OLD and seems like cask strength that age has brought down to about 50%. Some brininess, with lemony citrus. \\n\\n**Finish:** holy shit, that finish! Everything just sticks around forever, the smoke, the sweet peat, the fruit… wow. \\n\\n**Score:** 93\\n\\nthis is honestly one of the nicest whiskies I've ever tasted. I hesitate to give it such a high score but honestly I don't know if I've ever had sweet and peat work so well together before. The only thing I've had that compares is a Longrow Red. Might be another one in that series, or else it's something crazy like a 20+ year Laphroaig aged in sherry. or maybe it's some cheap readily available bottle, in which case, I know what I'm buying from now till I die...probably not that though. \\n\\n**REVEAL:** Caol Ila Hermitage from Gordon & MacPhail\\n\\nwell I overshot the ABV by 5 (it's 45%) and guessed sherry but it's Hermitage casks (which apparently I love). and guessed Islay at least. but can't claim even a half point here. 1 for 5. \\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nholy crap /u/devoz, your choices are amazing. don't even care if i get them all wrong. that was quite the delicious evening. \\n\\nwell, I only got 1 out of 5, which hit my second goal, but missed the first of getting 2/5 distilleries. oh well, this was a win either way. damn good drams. thanks a ton!\\n\",\n",

From the specs, I had hopes that it could potentially be the ex-bourbon equivalent of A\\'Bunadh (liberal interpretation... I know it\\'s not first fill bourbon). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:** Strong alcohol fumes (think cheap vodka or rubbing alcohol), \"green\" notes - lemon fizz, lime, fresh flowers, green leaves\\n\\n**Taste:** Intense heat, mixed with an upfront burst of juicy and sweet. Mouthful of fresh jalapeño, [Dole cherry mixed fruit cup](https://dolesunshine.com/products/fruit-bowls/cherry-mixed-fruit) (candied cherries, canned peaches w/ syrup, pear, white grapes), vanilla frosting, steamed chinese sponge cake (ma lai go)\\n\\n**Finish:** Short. Floral notes, sawdust, citrus sweetness. Very drying and a little chalky... this lasts long after everything else has faded. \\n\\n***\\n\\nA note of caution: the nose was 85% alcohol to 15% anything else. Taste was closer to 70% heat to 30% other notes. I find the heat to be a common theme for young cask strength Aberlour (if I recall, it was up front in my A\\'Bunadh batch 53 as well, but way better integrated into the whole in that one). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nInterestingly, a fresh pour when I first opened it had everything much more balanced, with nowhere near as much heat. Given several weeks to develop though and it seems sadly as if the heat has taken over. My review is reflective of sampling after this development. Very astringent, too hot and in combination with the high ABV... it actually left my tongue and the roof of my mouth a bit sensitive for a day or so afterwards (kind of like when you accidentally scald yourself with a sip of hot tea). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis one held promise, but a weak nose and finish, coupled with too much heat was just too much to overlook, holding it back for me in the end.

       " 'Thanks to /u/devoz for this sample.\\n\\nWhen one says \"Aberlour\", what comes to mind?\\n\\nIf you said \"Sherry Casks\", you may have thought I said Glenfarclas. Or maybe not.\\n\\nIf we look through the Aberlour line-up, it would seem that they have stocks in the Spanish fortified wine market. Or rather they\\'ve figured out their juice melds well with some sherry influence. And there\\'s nothing wrong with that at all.\\n\\nImagine you met someone who knew they were good at carrying things. You wouldn\\'t give them heck for taking a job where they carry things. Rather you\\'d pat them on the back and congratulate them for figuring out what they want to do. And ask them to carry your stuff.\\n\\nThe same goes for Aberlour. They\\'ve figured that sherry helps, and stick with it.\\n\\nHowever, that does leavethe question that Homer once asked: \" It makes you look like you\\'ve got something to hide...People are talking. Lots of people.\" Yes, Homer was talking about Ned\\'s moustache, but we see Ned shave it and people love it.\\n\\nSo what if we took the sherry away from Aberlour? What would that be like?\\n\\nLucky (or not) for us, we have **Aberlour SMWS 54.38 \"Confectionery and carpenters\"** to answer just such a question. This young malt is aged in just refill ex-bourbon barrels, and then served up at cask strength.\\n\\nCould it be a hidden gem? Or maybe, just maybe, someone knows what they are doing at the distillery? Let\\'s see.\\n\\n**Price:** Sold Out\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Date Distilled:** October 2006\\n\\n**Age:** 8 years\\n\\n**Cask Type:** Refill barrel\\n\\n**Outturn:** 210\\n\\n**Abv:** 62.8%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5Y 9/4\\n\\n**Nose:** Fizzy lemonade, almonds, hay, jelly beans, coal embers\\n\\nLight nose. Even at the high abv, given time or water, this is a very light nose. It really takes a lot to scrape every note I can from it.\\n\\nBarnyard scents take over quite a bit. And coal. It\\'s quite earthy with sharp sweet notes popping up.\\n\\n**Taste:** Brown sugar, cantaloupe, anise, pepper, mango, pistachio\\n\\nSweet forward. Young. Has some spice, but not enough. And some tropical fruits, which are nice, but again, not enough.\\n\\nActually I think \"not enough\" is the situation here, neighbourino. It needs to go to \"Hi-diddly-I\" but it doesn\\'t quite get past \"Hello\".\\n\\n**Finish:** Butter, oatmeal cookies, currant, cinnamon, raisin, hot\\n\\nFinish is nice, but again youth is rough here. It starts up with more and more spice. Finishes like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Which for some of you may make you swear to heck and darn it all, but for me I like it.\\n\\nAgain though, it\\'s not quite getting there. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Almost. Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a nice dram, but it\\'s not blowing my mind. It should be, given the alcohol percentage or the fact it\\'s from SMWS. But I think there\\'s two things going on here.\\n\\n1. Based on what I\\'ve had, I\\'d say this needs time. Aberlour doesn\\'t always need a lot of time, but it certainly helps.\\n\\n2. It needs sherry. I\\'ve had slightly older malts with sherry, and my compatriots in whisky have had these with more time and no sherry. End of the day? Aberlour needs sherry.\\n\\nDoes that mean I\\'ll never try an Aberlour without sherry again? You must not have been reading my reviews. Hells yes I will be.

It was loaded with sweet florals, candies, and fruits— all of which made it way too saccharine and sweet for me. A few drops of water tamped down some of the youthful spirit and surfaced some lovely citrus notes. However, I did not quite care for the way those combined with the background soapiness to create an almost creamy citrus body lotion. Certainly a weird dram— I thought it made for an excellent high ball and it was fun to play with for some home blending experiments. Overall, this would be an easy pass for me, while the nose was nice and the palate had a good presence, the flavor profile was not to my taste.\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average but still lovely; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)',\n",

I was hoping to be able to try something new, and was rather pleased with the Bruichladdich and Arran Malt expressions.  \\n\\nThere was also a food pairing component to each scotch, however I will only list what the pairing was without delving into how it went with it (I skipped a few of the samples).  One of the event descriptions made reference to serving haggis, though this turned out to be incorrect.

       " \"So, I'm new to reviewing scotch. I also rarely drink it due to cost - BC's liquor prices are very high.\\n\\nSo, because I'm new, this review might not be as exacting as others, or similar. I also only had this as a single from a pub.\\n\\n* Nose: Fruitcake, dried fruits (apricot, raisin, berries), definitely sweet. I'd almost say Christmasy.\\n* Palate: I tried this without watering it down first. Fire, wood, and alcoholic burn. A bit of sweetness. Not good.\\nAfter watering it down by adding a few teaspoons of water:\\nAhhh... there we go. The sweetness hits me, and there's a nice burn on my tongue. The fruitcake is there, and there's lots of dried fruits that came from the nose. There's a bit of wheatiness in there, but it's very weak.\\n* Finish: A bit sticky, but in a good way. The flavour lasts a long time, and there's definitely a good warmth.\\nOverall: Smooth, but definitely needs water for it to go down. The sweetness was a bit overpowering at times, actually.\\n\\nThe only other scotch I've had any experience with is the Glenlivet 12, and that had a more floral, crisp fruitiness to it. If I were to compare the two, I'd think of the Glenlivet 12 as early fall, just as things begin to cool down, and the A'bunadh as early winter, when it gets cold but you've got a fireplace going.\\n\\nBonus question: Is the Nadurra similar to the A'bunadh, or the Glenlivet 12? I might buy a bottle of that instead as my annual bottle.\\n\\nEdit: Fixed the formatting a bit.\",\n",

       " 'Cheerio, Scotchit! Thanks to my friend u/DrDite for this dram!\\n\\nI don’t get to drink a lot of Aberlour. There aren’t that many indie bottlings out there, and most of the official bottlings don’t really appeal to me. Of course, Aberlour’s much-celebrated A’bunadh is the prototypical ‘sherry bomb’: young, spicy, and angry. This, however, is A’bunadh Alba, a new bourbon-cask counterpart to the classic A’bunadh. ‘Alba’ is an old Gaelic word for Britain, and is derived from the Latin for ‘white’, referring to the white cliffs of Dover. This sort of fits for the name of a ‘white’ bourbon-matured A’bunadh, contrary to the darker colour of the classic A’bunadh.\\n\\nBut enough with the bad history lesson, how’s the whisky?\\n\\n***\\n\\t\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Alba Batch 1.** Speyside single malt. 57.1% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Local Price:** Not available in Ontario.\\n\\n**Barrels:** No age statement. Matured in ex-bourbon barrels and bottled at cask strength.\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 10 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Colour:** Light gold.\\n\\n**Nose:** Lots of sweet cereals, honey, salted butter, and some custard tarts. Buttercream-frosted birthday cake. Lemon pith, lightly floral, maybe some chestnut. As it sits in the glass, it turns more refreshing, with strong mint and lime notes.\\n\\nA small dribble of water adds some bubblegum and yellow apple flavours. \\n\\n**Palate:** Medium texture. Fairly spicy. Lemony and understated on the arrival, turning to heavy wood spice, powerful vanilla, old pencils, and grapefruit pith.\\n\\nThe dribble of water opens up the development with some more pastries and some brown sugar, and brings a hint of tobacco and kiwi to the development.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-length. Sort of a green floral note in there, with some more coconut, kiwi, and vanilla buttercream. Lingering muddled mint. u/xreekinghavocx mentioned chili peppers and quinine in [his review]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/eqqc51/aberlour_abunadh_alba/), which I totally get.\\n\\nWith water, the finish is relatively unchanged. \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Notes:** All in all, it’s pretty nice, though not really a standout. It suffers from the same trappings of the old A’bunadh, in that it’s young and fairly hot, but also like the old A’bunadh it improves with a bit of water. The flavours are straightforward, even a bit simple, but the mint and kiwi notes in particular are kind of neat. I think this actually compares favourably to the recent batches of A’bunadh I’ve had. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this for the right price, perhaps to people looking for their first CS whisky or to bourbon drinkers wanting to dip their toes into scotch.\\n\\n**Final score: 79/100** \\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. \\n\\n60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but it can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good. Quality stuff.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout dram.\\n\\n90-94: Personal favourite.\\n\\n95-100: Mythical.

       " \"Been struggling with 3 wisdom teeth recently and as a result my palate has been shot to hell. Rather annoying as I was hoping to finish off some more of my distillery reviews from my trip to Islay… Ahh well, in the meantime I thought I’d go through my large backlog of half-finished reviews and finally finish writing them up properly. For this one, I’ve pulled out notes from 27/12/17. From searching, it appears that this whisky hasn’t been submitted to the review archive before.\\n\\n***Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #1-5*** (*bottled circa 1997*) was the first run of (the now famous) A'bunadh cask strength single malt bottlings released from Speyside distillery Aberlour. The first 5 batches did not come with batch numbers, however, given that they were all released at 59.6% ABV (NCF, NAC) I’d make a guess that they were all from the same vatting (staggered releases?). Anyway, I guess such a gem of a single malt deserves an explanation as to how I got to try this. I was visiting my (now) Fiancée’s extended family for a new year’s celebration and her Uncle, upon heading that we’re both into our whisky, pulls out a very dusty bottle from the back of his cabinet (he isn’t really into his whisky now, but it was something that he picked up on a business trip). Upon seeing the label, the low fill-level, and recognising the lack of a batch number, I knew that I couldn’t refuse a pour as it was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. Sample rested for ~20 mins, then another 15mins with 2 drops of water, and nursed slowly in a sherry glass for the best part of an hour.\\n\\nRRP? Auction only now: ~£150-400, and it will only get more expensive, unfortunately. Picture from one of those auction sites as back then, pre-r/scotch, I was an idiot and didn’t think to take a picture. Regardless, I feel very fortunate to have lucked out to try this piece of history. Enough rambling, onto the review!\\n\\n**Appearance:** Ruby-red. \\n\\n**Nose:** Must, old leather-bound books, water brings out lots of red fruits, citrus, nuts, and sherry spices. Nose took a while with water to fully open up. \\n\\n**Palate:** Thick mouthfeel. Even neat it is shockingly rounded (I guess that’s what you get with ~15-20 years at a ~1/5 fill-level) – very oily, waxy and rich. Red apples, strawberries, walnuts, nutmeg, leather (like an old library), wax, toffee, ginger (heat), cinnamon and a delicious burnt molasses note. The drops of water really helped. Sweet and tart at the same time: oranges and lemons + cherries. \\n\\n**Finish:** LoooOOooOOOOoong. Rich, nutty, oaky and full of red fruits, walnuts, cinnamon, leather and dark chocolate. Velvety gingerbread. Orange, lemon zest and toasted oak give some nice balance to the sweetness.\\n\\n**Comments:** “Hey, Jim… *//swigs flask//* how about we get the most active sherry casks that we can get our hands on, and release a sherried-tactical-nuke of a cask strength release?” “You might be onto a winner there, mate” \\n\\n^ how I imagine Aberlour A'bunadh came about. Boy is this one hell of a sherry bomb… ***A'bunadh Batch #1-5***, like the rest of the line-up that followed, is entirely one dimensional in that regard but damn is it good at it. Waxy, citrus, sweet, and full of sherry-spices =olid “Great”-tier single malt for me.

       " \"As many of you know, I live in the Great White Land-of-Provincial-Liquor-Regulation, and our prices for whisky suck. See, the government had this whole prohibition idea, and then when it ended, they decided they still needed to babysit us and ensure we didn't drink too much. Thus was born the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which today has morphed into a retailing giant that spends a ton of money on advertising to increase demand for alcoholic beverages, while maintaining a pricing strategy rooted in deterring demand for alcoholic beverages...also, they're terrible at both. Why do I rant about this in a whisky review? because today I'm reviewing one of the few bottles that is actually priced reasonably in this province!  Aberlour A'bunadh is a sherry-bomb-lovers-wet-dream, and I have the great fortune of reviewing 3 batches side by side today. I bought a bottle a long time ago, and happened to end up with batch 46. A huge thanks to /u/boyd86 for batch 53, which i swapped for back in November 2016, and to /u/slackerdude for the swap of batch#6 that I swapped for in March 2016. No, that wasn't a typo, the slacker came across it randomly on a shelf one day and it was an obvious insta-buy. Apparently someone must have had it on a shelf, saw how it had appreciated in price since it was launched back in 1999. crazy. anyway, on to the cask strength three-way! I'm going to review each element side by side, rather than going one dram at a time. I'll also lay it out in table format rather than bullet points for easy comparison across batches. \\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh | Batch #6 | Batch #46 | Batch #53\\n--------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------\\n**Appearance** | deep reddish orange with fat sexy legs | similar to #6 but slightly less red. | lighter still, but still a pink-orange hue. The legs on this one are incredible.\\n**Nose** | rich fruity nose, lots of berries, cherries, demerara sugar, caramel, red licorice, spices  | quite different than batch 6. much less fruit but somehow more sugary and a lot more oak influence. raspberry, caramel, vanilla, molasses. Less spicy than 6 | sweeter yet than the other two, and a bit more cloying. Not as much spice either.\\n**Palate** | a lot more woodiness than I expected to get. Quite dry, almost tannic, tart, nutty, with a ton of dark dried fruit. Raisins, figs, caramel, molasses. Delicious. A dry sherry bomb. strawberry, chocolate on those strawberries. More oak tannins, dry nutty goodness. wow | much sweeter than batch 6. way more sugary fruit, berries, chocolate,  tons of spice like cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes much more youthful too and runs quite a bit hotter than the older batch.  | very different once again. Doesn't run nearly as hot as batch 46. has more of the nuttiness I expect from oloroso sherry, and it's super dry once again… dries out the mouth like a nice dry wine. Earthy, chocolate, light spiciness, red fruit, caramel, toffee, molasses. \\n**Finish** | long, dry, fruity and not overly sweet.  | medium, hot, spicy, sweet, and slightly bitter | longer than 46. dry, nutty, fruity. \\n**Overall** | This strikes a fantastic balance of some sweetness with a dry tannic character. Tons of flavour and each element shines through without over-powering the others.  | this batch isn't nearly as balanced as #6, and the cloying sweetness overpowers much of the other notes and it runs so hot I feel it needs water, unlike the other two. I previously rated this an 89, but that will be going down now that I've compared to its brethren. | batch 53 thankfully is better than 46 and gets back to the more balanced approach of batch 6. it has some sweetness, along wth a good punch of wood and dry tannic character. I'm having a hard time choosing which I like better, 6 or 53. \\n**Score** | 91 | 84 | 90\\n\\nin the end, I'm choosing batch 6 as my favourite. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and tend to love dry sherried malts, particularly a well done oloroso cask. This one just balances it all beautifully. The 46 is just way too sweet for me to score it as high as I did the first time... maybe my tastes have changed or something. The 53 is delicious and dry, but runs slightly hotter and isn't quite as balanced as 6.  Overall, such an awesome experience seeing the variations between batches. I WANT MORE!\\n\\n[Here is the review on my group's website](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/2017/01/24/aberlour-abunadh-three-way-review-batches-6-46-53/)\",\n",

And that means I gotta offer more.\\n\\nLet's add to the fact that just because something is old doesn't make it good. If you want to prove that, try drinking out of ancient pots and see how long until you get your lifetime supply of lead in your system.\\n\\nWhen I was offered a sample of **Aberlour a'bunadh batch 6**, I didn't know how to react.

Because.. well, shit man, when am I going to be here again? And I just got around to trying it. Because I have a huge backlog.\\n\\n**Aberlour a'bunadh batch 6** is a NAS cask strength version of the Aberlour we all know and love. The company is well known for bringing lots and lots of these out, and variance between casks is probably the most of any Scotch I know of.\\n\\nAnd that's a small sample, I know. But I feel I can say it with the confidence that when I'm proven wrong, I'll just chalk it up to being human.\\n\\nEnough jibber jabber, let's see how it tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** No longer available in Ontario\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside\\n\\n**Abv:** 59.9%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10R 3/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Cherry, brown sugar, homemade cranberry sauce, margarita, alcohol, strawberry\\n\\nBig, tart flavours on the nose. This whole thing smells like cranberry sauce. And not the creepy shit from a can, the homemade, really tasty stuff.\\n\\nGood amount of acid, however it's not as sweet as Batch 45. It's certainly smells as strong.\\n\\n**Taste:** Caramel, butter, strawberry, ginger, anise\\n\\nLess complex than the nose would have you believe. More spice, some sweetness, and some acid.\\n\\nIt's missing something. Can't quite put my finger on it. I want some cinnamon or some more strawberry or more sweets.\\n\\n**Finish:** Black pepper, grape, mineral water, craisins, orange rind\\n\\nStrong finish on this one. So it has that going for it.\\n\\nThat said, it's missing any sweets at the end. It's tart, huge tart bomb. Massive tart bomb. Like, if you found a whole bunch of slutty women from the 1950s, and exploded them, it would be less of a tart bomb.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I think I can tell the difference between this batch and Batch 45. 39 batches of experience. Maybe also a drier sherry was used on this one. Or maybe the acids didn't jive as much.\\n\\nOr maybe it wasn't a good year for Spain. Or Scotland. We'll never know. What I do know is this batch would be preferred by people who aren't sweets crazy like me.\\n\\nIn the end it is what it is. I enjoyed it, and I'm happy to have tried it. I think I'd offer it to anyone who wants a more dry sherry influence.

They had a nice deal on a bourbon flight that allowed me to try a few I hadn't before (Rebel Yell, Old Charter, Stagg).  My eye also shot to their scotch selection that was sort of tucked away.  I noticed an unopened Aberlour A'bunadh with the old label and asked to see the bottle.  Batch 9!?!

       " \"Hey again guys! Here I am again but this time with my 11th review! This island resort I went to has this Tabacalera room with the widest single malt selection I have ever seen in my life! There was Benriach, Old Pulteney, Glendronach, Macallan, Glenfiddich and sitting there at the top were Aberlours and right in the middle was a bottle of an A'bunadh Batch 19. NOT OPENED. This is 59.9% if I recall correctly.\\n\\nColor: Amber Red \\n\\nNosing: Fruitty, honey, chocolate, sherry, sweetness (lovely!)\\n\\nTasting: Sherry, sweet, fruity (apples and plums), chocolate, candy\\n\\nFinish: a lovely lingering blast of sherry, sweetness, chocolate, sugar and candy and fruits\\n\\nTasting with a bit of water: the fruity and chocolate flavors became more alive. I recommend adding a bit of water!!!\\n\\nConclusion: Bloody brilliant. I will not mind dying if I can have this before I die. This is the perfect Scotch that I have been wanting all along. \\n\\nScore: 96\\n\\nAnother note: I was not able to buy a bottle of this sadly. I tasted this through buying a dram worth P600 which is about $15 USD. The bottle cost $140 since they make everything x2 or 3 in the island resort. I shared this with my bro-in-law who instantly fell in love with this and told me that he will give Scotch another chance. I was able to talk to the GM of the resort too and he told me where he gets the goods!\",\n",
       " \"***Review #2 - Aberlour A'Bunadh - Batch 36***\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Wow, this is a beautiful looking whiskey. Turning it around in  the glass, watching the light refract through it.  Medium caramel gold with a slight copper tinge.  It looks lighter, yet still very rich. I almost don't want to drink it so I can keep staring at it.\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** definitely some alcohol there, but that to be expected of such a strong whiskey.  Smells amazingly sweet, but not in an overbearing way.  Vanilla, butter, and brown sugar make up the majority of the head.  \\n\\n\\nI said earlier that it looked rich, well looks have nothing on the nose here.  I feel like I need to be drinking this on a roundish bed while wearing all velvet.  Unfortunately, the best I can do now is put Crown Royal bags on my feet like slippers.\\n\\n\\nAfter the initial burst, I can smell small bits of cinnamon and nutmeg, and even caramelized apple.  Basically, apple pie nectar of the gods.\\n\\n\\nFinally, I'm picking up some darker fruits and yeast on the end.  It reminds me a lot of dark Belgian beers, specifically, Gulden Draak and Monk's Blood (Belgian brewed with cinnamon).\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Swirling it around, the first thing I notice is how thick it is, almost like nectar.  The liquid strands running down the side are surprisingly thick for a 60% scotch.  Quite strong and vibrant. I can feel it sparkle down my tongue while warming my whole mouth up. Is this the KY of whiskey? This is no doubt due to the strength.  (This is my first cask strength whiskey, by the way). Slightly oily, but far less so than The Lagavulin 16 from my first review.  \\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Mmm, sherry, everywhere.  I first got introduced to sherry casked whiskeys from The Macallan 12, but I enjoyed this richer flavor much more.  The warm butter and brown sugar really flourishes midway through tasting.  I feel like a king drinking this.  It's almost hard to separate flavors as everything is so dense and complex, so I added a bit of water.  Definitely opened it up a lot and allows a rookie like me to pick up on a few new things.  The dark fruit clears up to be raisins, and I'm also noticing a bit of orange zest.\\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Seriously impressed by this. It makes my blanket feel like a hot lady, and my space heater feel like a roaring fireplace.  Something that's definitely new to me is actual changes taking place during the finish.  With most whiskeys I've tried before this (granted, most were junk) but they just faded away with the exact same flavors.  I can feel the Aberlour morph and change the longer I hold it in my mouth.  This kind of complexity is pretty alarming in a good way.\\n\\n\\nI do notice an off taste, though. I can't place it, but it’s familiar.  It's a dry, dusty taste, but beyond that I can't say much more.  I've heard there is some variety in quality between different batches, so this could be the result of that, or the sample container, or the glass I'm using, or just something weird with my tongue today, so I hesitate to knock it too much for this, especially since it's fairly subtle.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** It was nice to try something completely different than The Lagavulin.  I can't say I like one style more than the other, but switching to the near opposite end of the spectrum makes for a great change in sensation.  I did, during this review, take a quick swig of the only other Speyside I had handy, The Glenlivet 12, and it easily surpasses it.  While The Glenlivet tastes fresher and more lively, there's something intoxicating about the the slow sophistication of The Aberlour A'bunadh.  \\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100 (If no aftertaste in subsequent tastings, 92/100)\\n\",\n",
       " \"**Ardbeg Corryvreckan**\\n\\n* **Nose**: Now this is what I'm talking about: clam bake!  Peat, smoky bonfire, salty brine seaside air goodness.\\n\\n* **Taste**: Whew this is potent, is this cask strength and someone forgot to tell me?  Very thick, oily, salty, campfire smoke, I am at the beach (New England in fall, not the tropics).\\n\\n* **Finish**: Dry finish, interesting considering the nose and taste.  Some sherry spice comes out and lingers nicely.  The seasside bonfire nose really moves to a thick complex taste, and the sherry and balance reveals itself in the finish.\\n\\n**Score**: 73/75 for enjoyment, 22/25 for value.  **95**/100 overall.\\n\\n**Overall Thoughts**: probably the best actual scotch I tasted, but my overall score for QC was higher based on cost - Corryvreckan is nearly double the cost of QC for a slightly better scotch.  This one instantly took me to another place (clam bake mentioned above) and that's a really special thing when you can find a scent and taste that just takes you somewhere else, especially somewhere awesome.\",\n",
       " \"Hello fellow malt heads, today I've got some notes about my time spent with Aberlour last night while I caught up on some UFC (162 - Roger Gracie's debut). It's been particularly warm (88 degrees!) in my area over the past week and so I brought out my Aberlour samples and my tasting journal and wrote up some notes while I enjoyed some MMA. Organizing my notes this morning while rocking out to some Queens of the Stone Age.\\n\\nAfter my first expression from Aberlour with the 12 year old Double Cask Matured I was eager to sit down with the flag-ship expressions (A'Bunadh and 12NCF). I figured I should taste them all in order to get a good feel for their spirit from start to finish. Here are my tasting notes from the night and one extra set of notes from back in June during a group tasting with a friend who brought his bottle of A'Bunadh Batch #30, Yum! Cheers\\n\\n----\\n\\n[Previous Review notes of **Aberlour 12 Double Cask**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1gqqol/aberlour_12_double_cask_matured_speyside_single/camtv6c) - This was my Review #31\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *43%* \\n\\n- **Price** $40 - 750ml bottle\\n  \\n**[Tasted Neat](http://i.imgur.com/Dz3ZsVS.jpg)** - [Pictured here on the right](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)\\n\\n- **Color:** Deep Amber, Liquid Copper\\n\\n- **Nose:** Very faint sherry influence, red apple, slight burn, orange pith, touch of vanilla, upfront medicinal alcoholic wall. *A simple barely sweet and bitter slightly burn-y nose that leaves you searching but comes up short before the alcohol*\\n\\n- **Taste:**  Watery-light oily, soft intro, light citrus, sour fruit, warms and thickens to a hot spiciness, pepper, astringent. *Not very impressed with the palate here, very lacking and somewhat in-line with the simple nose*\\n\\n- **Finish:**  Peppered apple, sour citrus, hot and fast on the palate, fades leaving a pepper flavor and a zing of light burnt sugar. *A quick hot finish of citrus, apple and pepper with a light toffee trail*\\n\\n**Summary** \\nWell, this feels like very young spirit to me, I was expecting a bit more sherry and oak in this to be honest but it was a pretty shallow nose. I hit a few fruits and slight sherry and then a brick wall of medicinal alcoholic vapor. The palate was anti-climactic, watery to light oily, hot and sour and peppery, into a finish of the same apple, pepper, citrus that trails off into a weak toffee flavor.\\n\\n**72/100** \\n*This one was a complete miss for me, didn't enjoy any part of it really. Money is better spent elsewhere imo. I think I'm coming to find out I'm not a fan of super peppery malts and blends*\\n\\n**Update:** Now that I've had the big hitters from Aberlour I feel this original score was a bit harsh as I know the destination this malt is going for. After my tasting last night I would probably bump it up to **79/100**. It's not a terrible malt, but not amazing either. It really loses a lot of the flavor profile with the chill-filtering, this is a great example of what that process does to single malt. Still not a fan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Review #57**\\n----\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non-chillfiltered** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *48%*  \\n\\n**[Enjoyed Neat](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)** - Middle glass\\n\\n- **Price** $60 - 750ml bottle \\n\\n- **Color:** Light Amber hue, Un-filtered honey\\n\\n- **Nose:** Sherry oak, strawberry preserves, salty, honey, almonds, marzipan, fresh river air, airy sense, damp forest, pleasantly complex\\n\\n- **Taste:** Sweet Bursting sherry, berry pie filling, warm spices, sweetness, sherry oak, thickens and warms, slight orange peel note, medium oily, complex - Full bodied and pleasantly oily mouth feel.\\n\\n- **Finish:** Dark fruits, great oak flavor and some almonds, a little peppery with faint notes of oranges, warm long finish that is smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n**Summary**  \\nA huge improvement over the standard 12 year expression. The complexity has been doubled here guys, the NCF is a very nice Speysider. I could see getting a full bottle of this one, they've really hit the sweet spot of their spirit in this expression.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the palate and finish most on this dram, the nose is definitely enjoyable too but the flavors here are what hooked me.

I remember this one being a little better than the Batch #40 below It seemed to have more of those deep sherry and fruity flavors than the the Batch #40 and is just a few points higher for me. It's definitely cool to see that there are differences batch to batch, keeping a consistent product seems like witchcraft in Whisky so I don't fault them at all.

       " 'Good evening, friends!  Here are my notes for my first go at a modest vertical review.  These two big sherried offerings from Aberlour are quite beloved of the larger community of malt-heads out there, and justifiably so, as I\\'ve come to find out.  I also thought it would be educational (and, you know, delicious) to try a few whiskies of very similar profiles to see whether the differences between them might be thrown into relief.  Gonna change up my review style a touch, too.  On to the whisky!\\n\\n\\n\\n**Aberlour \"A\\'bunadh\" Single Malt, batch 32 (60.4% abv), non chill-filtered**\\n\\n\\n* **Color:** pretty\\n\\n* **On the nose:** right away you\\'re swimming in rich milk chocolate, oranges, and I suppose chocolate oranges?  Cherries make me think of Black Forest cherry cake, and then there\\'re sugared hazelnuts, Nutella, ginger, nutmeg, and maybe a whiff of cardamom?  Maybe I\\'m getting ahead of myself.  Definitely figs, buttery sugary cookies, and toffee.  With a teaspoon or two of water there\\'s more brown sugar, syrup/molasses... maybe root beer?  Some of the fruit becomes like a tawny port, with golden raisins aplenty.\\n\\n\\n* **Taste and Finish:** here are all of these sweet dried fruits and zingy baking spices... pow!  There\\'s a pleasant and just slightly bitter nuttiness, and something rummy... sugarcane?  Nice creamy cappuccino notes too.  Dense, dessert-y as expected, and pretty indulgent.  Finish is long and powerful (thanks, high proof!) and alternates dried fruit and nuttiness.  Trying to compare my recent memory of the Macallan CS with this, I\\'d say I recall a touch more of the butter and dry spice in the Mac, and maybe a teensy bit more dried fruit in the A\\'bunadh?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m a big fan of this A\\'bunadh.  I\\'m glad it\\'s readily available and generally not too awfully pricey.  In my own personal preference, I think I slightly prefer the buttery spice of the Macallan over this, but that\\'s really splitting small subjective hairs between two lovely whiskies.  Would I buy a bottle?  Sure.  I have a lot of great sherried whisky vying for my attention for the moment, however, so I might have to wait!  Big thanks to my pal /u/BaronScarpia for the sample!\\n\\n>**89/100**\\n\\n****\\n\\n**Aberlour 12-year old Non-Chill-Filtered, 48% abv**\\n\\n* **Color:** see above\\n\\n* **On the nose:** Again we\\'re burying ourselves in chocolate, only this time it\\'s dark, concentrated, bitter chocolate, which I adore.  Some very appealing mixtures of sweet, slightly bitter, and spicy flavors present themselves: burnt sugar, dry orange rind, tad of mint, allspice, and really nice balanced chewy sherry fruit, like prunes, dates, raisins, dried apricots.  A little walnuts and coffee show up too.\\n\\n* **Taste and finish:** I get much of what was in the nose, and that\\'s fine by me.  Dark bitter chocolate, nutty, and espresso with cream and sugar.  Actually I\\'m thinking it\\'s a lot like tiramisu with the espresso.  Damn.  Also, faint chiles?  Finish is long, but somewhat gentler than the A\\'bunadh, with sweetness, spice, and a little touch of smoke, reminding me of chipotle peppers.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m gonna have to call this my favorite heavily sherried whisky I\\'ve had so far.  While I love the big power of the A\\'bunadh and Mac CS, I\\'m really into the impressive balance of this 12.  It seems that all its elements - the dried fruit, nuts, slight bitter spice, and so on - play against one another without any one ever taking over.  It\\'s so delicious and I only wish it were more readily available.  I might\\'ve given this an even higher score if my untouched bottle of Glenfarclas 105 weren\\'t staring me down, daring me to pay it some attention (and to leave room in my scale).

Similar to how Aberlour 12 was to me, most of them tasted too sharp or had too much of a metallic tinge; it\\'s hard for me to describe but they grate on my tongue. These so-called \"sherry monsters,\" though, have taught me that sometimes more is indeed more. And while I\\'m usually a stickler for subtlety and complexity, the overpowering and sense-numbing sherry apocolypse on my palate is more than welcome.

       " \"Hello scotch enthusiasts one and all. Here's a quick review of a well known player on the scotch scene. I'm quite an Aberlour fan, [I went to visit them](http://imgur.com/a/j2jnb#0) and have had some amazing drams of theirs but for some reason this one was one I got now and again at the bar, never going out to get a bottle. I aim to change that. Aberlour a'Bunadh is aged in ex-Oloroso sherry casks and has a bunch of different batches from 6 to 46. \\n\\n*Aberlour a'Bunadh Batch 34, Speyside single malt, ABV 59.5%, non chill filtered, natural colour*\\n \\n- Nose: Black cherries, raspberry jam, orange marmalade, marzipan, red wine, blackcurrants, molasses, apricots, dark chocolate, raisins, vanilla and buttercream, central sherry with some Christmas mincemeat spice in the background\\n \\n- Palate: Full on dried cherries and red fruits, [Cadbury eclairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_Eclairs), manuka honey and malt extract coating everything, full-bodied red wine, rich fruitcake, ginger, blood orange, with air a blackcurrant cough syrup flavour, toasted oak in the background, oily becoming waxy mouthfeel.\\n \\n- Finish: More honey, sticky toffee pudding, leather, cocoa powder, cloves, caramel shortbread, plums, [Vimto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimto), tannic and dry, glowing burn that lingers\\n\\n> 90/100\\n\\nThis is the signature sherry monster many (especially in Europe) turn to and it stands out as one of the must have cask strengths. For good reason. It's big on fruit in the nose and has all the sherry monster characteristics - dried fruits, heavy sherry and wine, Christmas spices but also central dense orange flavours, toffee/caramel, malt and dark honey, chocolate and a dry bitterness. In many ways it tastes very much like the [Aberlour 16 SB I hand-filled](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/158c7b/handfilled_at_the_distillery_aberlour_16_year/)  though with subtle differences. I wouldn't be surprised if the sherry finished 15 or 16 year spirit wasn't added to this. I love the depth and complexity from the nose and palate that could keep me busy for hours and I love the interplay between sweet fruit, confectionery and desserts on one hand - and bitter spices, leather, dark chocolate and dry citric acidity on the other. Amazing whisky, amazing cask strength purchase, try it at all costs!\",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh 119 proof batch 34**\\n\\n* Color: Auburn\\n* Nose: sweet sherry nectar, honey dew\\n* Taste: malty dates, rosey almonds. Red grapes with orange zest.  \\n* Finish: hot and stays hot for a while\\n\\n\\nVery much like the Macallan Cask Strength which is a personal favorite.  It has a slightly higher proofage than Macallan as well.  Matured in Spanish Oloroso sherry butts.  A worthy Highland but I have to pick the Macallan over it because it lacks the same spicey character.  Still a wonderful malt in its own and the Aberlour 12 has a very reasonable price for intro-ing to Sherry casks.  I would definitely pick this over say a Tomatin.  \\n\\n>93/100\",\n",

       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 35: 60.3% ABV   $CDN 89**\\n\\n**Colour:** Tawny caramel with tones of orange.\\n\\n**Nose:** Strong and rich sherry.  Raisins and vanilla.  Hints reminiscent of chocolate rum cake with nuts.   Peppery alcohol and brown sugar fudge.  Has definite presence.\\n\\n**Palate:** Initally sweet, hovering for half a second then a strong dollop of lemon pepper that flows across the tongue.  Sherry is present, blending nicely. Gives way to malt and vanilla oak, all shot through with pleasantly prickling alcohol. Coats the mouth.  \\n\\n**Finish:** Flavour continues for a reasonable amount of time fading into pins and needles and slightly sour tastes of malty fruit preserves and hints of lemonade.  Cinnamon at the back of the tongue with wood and faint hints of smoke in the nose as one swallows.  \\n\\n**Notes:** Taken neat, this batch is delicious and engaging through each sip.  It engages the senses and keeps you paying attention as you enjoy it.  It has a variety of flavours from sweet sherry to nuttiness, vanilla wood and fading to malt and lemons.  It is unfortunately reasonably expensive where I live (compare to the Macallan Cask which is 72$), but is one I would keep on hand regardless.  \\n\\n**Score:** 94  - *Warms me to the toes and makes me enjoy life.*\",\n",
       " \"Hey guys, here's my reviewing virginity. Sorry if it's a little long winded.\\n\\nNose:\\n\\nI find the nose of the Aberlour to be very light – powerful, but not overwhelming in any sense.  Caramel and fruits are brought to light, as is a touch of oak that carries through the scotch. \\n\\nPalette:\\n\\nAt first, it seems quite simple. For an unrefined mouth such as mine, the cask strength is far too much.  I simply feel as though I’m back at community college pounding back swills of Canadian Club.  However, with a couple drops of water, the A’bunadh opened up to me, warmly greeting the tip of my tongue with subtleties of honey and chocolate. Perhaps a touch of lemon, but this may simply be my dishwashing liquid polluting my glass.  As I move onward, the sherry cask, shy at first, now roams freely and brings an affront of flavor to the scotch. \\n\\nFinish:\\n\\nClean and polished – quite professional.  It does not linger more than it must for the last of sherried oak to say its goodbyes. It is pervasive, and somewhat rummy, but not intrusive. As I believe all good scotch should, this is not one to simply drink, but rather experience.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nAt the moment, my favorite scotch by far. Each sip of each dram is a sparkling example of complexity and simplicity in a single package. Simple, in that if one wants to learn the effects of sherry casks, it will provide ample evidence for someone even as unsophisticated as myself. However, complex, in that if one takes time, one can sift through a spectrum of flavor by only lifting the glass once. My overall rating would be 88/100.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\",\n",

Unfortunately, the Batch 36 A'Bunadh is now empty and won't be in the VS section where I sampled them all against each other :( \\n\\nFirst up-- The set of 4 A'Bunadh\\n\\n**Batch 36 - 60.1% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: caramel, strawberry, maraschino cherry, nutmeg?, cinnamon?, chocolate, something I can't quite put my finger on -> maybe fresh pine?\\n\\nAll kinds of delicious coming through here! The sweet, balanced by the spices - fantastic in my books!\\n\\n**Palate**: Strawberry, sweet, very oily and thick feeling. It took me a while to figure what it was that I was missing, but I think it's a sour maraschino cherry note that is coming through in a fantastic way.\\n\\n**Finish**: more strawberry again, spices of cinnamon, and a sweetness that comes through to me as icing sugar, that drying sweetness. \\n\\nAs an overall, I wish I had some more of this left in that open bottle. When it was still available, I did get myself a 2nd so that I can revisit it in the years to come.\\nI ranked this one in at **93**/100\\n\\n**Batch 39 - 59.8% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: candied fruit, lemon grass, salt, cloyingly sweet caramel, oranges, chocolate\\n\\nNo hint of the ABV on the nose, but all kinds of delicious just waiting to be found here in my glass\\n\\n**Palate**: WOW there's the alcohol, unfortunately too overwhelming to really pick out the elements from the nose, I had to press it\\n\\n**Finish**: spices and cranberry\\n\\nExcellent finish, but on the palate, way too much alcohol to pick anything out when it is taken neat.  \\n\\n**Pressed notes**: ~10drops\\n\\nNose: more caramel, more salt, orange\\n\\nPalate: oranges, caramel, spices\\n\\nFinish: spices, caramel, chocolate dryness\\n\\nThis one, **92**/100\\n\\n**Batch 40 - 60.0% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: Sweet!, leather, light spices of a variety I can't place, toffee, Werther's originals, slight hint of high ABV\\n\\n**Palate**: CS!, spicy, oily, chocolate and prunes\\n\\n**Finish**: chocolate, spices -> like a hot apple cider\\n\\nNot as rich a finish or palate as the other 2 above, but still quite good, **88**/100.\\n\\n**Batch 46 - 60.4%**\\n\\n**Nose**: very young - lots of alcohol prevalent here, toffee apple, lemon zest, coca, strawberry, light cinnamon\\n\\n**Palate**: difficult to get passed the alcohol, peppery, ginger, buttery, bing cherry, some cherry as well\\n\\n**Finish**: pepper, drying, strawberries\\n\\nThis one was much noticeably younger than the previous mentions here. So even though it's similar ABV, it was much more apparent than the others, even with a press it was more difficult to pick apart the pieces. Unfortunately, this is definitely the younger brother not measuring up to the others. **80**/100 here.\\n\\n**Macallan CS 1st release - 60.1%**\\n\\nI sampled this one with the Glencairn and the Canadian Glencairn, so a few nosing notes from each of them. For a bit of a change, I put the nosing notes of the Canadian in *italics* along with the Glencairn in regular, just to make things a bit neater. Where I go the same notes, I've indicated with an +.\\n\\n**Nose**: Cherry+, caramel+, some alcohol *slightly more intense with the Canadian*, after a while this turned floral+, *dates*, *nail polish remover*\\n\\nThe cherry note is very strong in this one! With the 2 glasses having about 1oz each, the whole of the room was filled with the smell. Also smelled of apple blossoms after a spring rain throughout the room. Super rich on the nose, very, very intense!\\n\\n**Palate**: feels tingly on the tongue, oily and rich, there's a sweetness to this one to go with the cherries, which are the predominant note here, kind of like an alcoholic cherry danish\\n\\n**Finish**: Cherry, MacIntosh toffee, lasts forever and ever (still had some finish the next morning and yes I brushed my teeth and used mouth wash....), on the breath is like canned cherry juice - delicious!\\n\\nThis was much sharper than some of the A'Bunadhs and in some ways not quite as complex, but with the nose filling the room as it did this is an amazing dram! **94**/100\\n\\n**Bowmore Devil's Cask - 56.9%**\\n\\nThis one is a re-review from quite some time ago when I first started reviewing here. This time around I've used a Canadian Glencairn for the review. I've brought the previous notes along in italics for comparison sake.\\n\\n**Nose**: Musty, caramel, leather, fruity, some alcohol present\\n\\n*unknown fruit, pine? leather, light spice, caramel, some alcohol*\\n\\n**Palate**: Leather, dark fruits, caramel, sweet and musty\\n\\n*smoke, ABV comes through, thick and oily after a bit of time swirling in the mouth, caramel, fruitcake, dark chocolate (90%), tingly on the tongue*\\n\\n**Finish**: musty, fruity, with a long lingering fruit juice note\\n\\n*spices, dried dark fruit, sweet, medium-long*\\n\\nI had previously scored this at a 90, although I think my liking for it has increased. The overall fit and finish for this scotch is fantastic! I would say just as delicious as the A'Bunadh 39.\",\n",

It was so smooth, and buttery that any mouth smack was masked with its rich feel. I also expected sherry to be dominant, but it wasn’t. It served as a platform for other flavours. The heat presented itself as mixed spices on the finish. This is well worth the money, though with any small batch, it can vary, but I seem to enjoy just about everything Aberlour produces.

Cracked it open on New Year's Eve, and I'm almost half way through it already. Seems like a good one to do my first review on.\\n\\n\\nNose: Sweet, creamy caramel, lots of raisin, prunes\\n\\nTaste: First sip: Wow this is pretty heavy stuff, syrupy, strong, a little bit cough syrupy but in a good way. Some real heat in this malt. A little bit of spice, some dark cocoa. A really enjoyable burning sensation.\\nSince this is a cask strength, at 60% abv, I added a good bit of water to see how it would open up. It becomes more fruity, the sweetness of it is more apparent and the burn subsides.\\n\\nFinish: I think I like it best with a little bit of water, the finish this way is a nice warm sensation in the back of the throat. Some taste of dried fruit remains, raisins and prunes mostly.\\n\\n\\nTaste: 70/75\\n\\nValue: 14/15 @ $60, a good price for this beast of a cask strength speyside.\\n\\nUniqueness: 4/5\\n\\nBuy Again: 4/5 - I think I will have to get another once I run out, but not before I replenish my stock of the Laphroaig QC.\\n\\nTotal: 92/100\\n\\nEven though I love smoke and peat and the A'bunadh doesnt really have any of either, it's just such a unique and full-bodied treat that I can't help but like it a lot. I'd drink this as dessert after any meal.\",\n",
       " \"\\nAberlour A'bunadh batch #36\\n\\n\\nColour: Madeira wine\\n\\nNose: Orange rind, vanilla, tobacco, and figs. Surprisingly, the\\n60.1 % abv doesn't mask any of the nose. With Dilution:\\nNot a tremendous difference. Perhaps more sherry in the\\ninitial delivery and a bit of copper.\\n\\nTaste: Buttery toffee giving way to the oak. Raisins, custard,\\nending in earthy spices. With dilution: the brandy creaminess\\ncomes on stronger, as does the vanillin in the oak. The fruit\\nbecomes less sharp and more juicy,\\n\\nFinish: Very long and sweet with a touch of salt. With dilution:\\nThe sweetness dominates.\\n\\n**91/100**\\n\\nBatch #36 of Aberlour A'bunadh comes in a bit less sweet than other\\nbatches of the last few years. Spice was the surprise here, but the\\nclassic sherry bomb nature of the A'bunadh is still much in evidence.\\nThis is a toothsome scotch, one that you can almost chew. As such,\\nit makes a perfect after dinner drink or a dessert replacement. If sherry\\nbombs are your thing, then look no further. \",\n",
       " \"Thanks to /u/ibanner56 for the sample!  Another day, another batch of A'bunadh... except this one is really old!  I've found that the general progression of A'bunadh batches has been very downhill for my palate.  The newer ones are sweeter and younger tasting.  But I've only really had batches from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.  So here we have batch 36, bottled back in 2011.  Bottled at cask strength, 60.1% ABV.  No added color and non-chill filtered.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Nose:**  Darkly rich and sweet.  Caramel.  Molasses.  Brown butter.  Some ethanol heat.  Raisins.  Birch bark.\\n\\n\\n**Palate:**  Thick and unctuous mouthfeel.  Rich and syrupy.  Very sweet.  Caramel.  Maple syrup.  Brown sugar.  Toffee.  A bit hot.  Raisins.  Plums.  Christmas pudding.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Finish:**  Long finish.  The sweetness lingers for a long time.  I get more earth now.  Some black pepper.  A bit of heat.  Lingering peppery heat.\\n\\n\\n**Score:**  89\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis is a very good A'bunadh - but not the best.  I really like it, but its just a bit too much on the sweet side for my tastes.  Almost like a PX cask version, though I don't think they actually use PX casks (all Oloroso).  Though while its too sweet for my tastes, it doesn't seem too young like the newer batches.  Its a bit hot, but mostly just warming and delicious.  And the finish goes on forever.  I feel like the people who like overly sweet dessert drams (see Bunnahabhain 14 PX) would gobble this up with horny abandon.  But while I really like it, its not my favorite batch.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'Aberlour'\",\n",
       " \"Hello Scotchit! I said I'd do this a while ago, but here I finally am with my first review. I purchased this to celebrate getting a great new job, and it does not disappoint! \\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh Batch #36\\n60.1% abv, purchased at $60\\n\\n* **Color:** Dark Amber, Madiera\\n* **Nose:** Vanilla, creamy toffee/caramel, hints of citrus and other fruits (raisins, hints of plum).\\n* **Taste:** First thing I notice is an incredibly creamy sherry. Vanilla sweetness, subtle spiciness followed by a slight citrus/fruit bite. When you add water, you get a buttery creaminess while the fruity notes really smooth out\\n* **Finish:** Warm all the way down. Wonderful spicy/citrus notes, especially if you exhale through your mouth. \\n\\nThis dram is something rather special. Even after trying this with water, I prefer it neat. It is one of the few cask strength whiskys I have had that I think does not need any water. The strength of the whisky really enhances the flavors here. The sweetness of the sherry really makes this a wonderful desert scotch. At $60, this is really a great value for the quality you are getting. \\n\\n**92/100**\",\n",
       " 'Well Scotchit, the wife was out of town, I got an unexpected bonus, and I had a few bottles that I hadn’t opened yet.  Perfect opportunity to open six at once,  BBQ a couple steaks, and have a good time with family.  My father and brother were here to help me sample six fantastic scotches.  I’m only posting my own notes, because I was barely sober enough to do my own.  That’s right, we did all six at once!  Posting them in the order we tasted them.\\n\\n#1\\n\\n>**Balvenie 15 Single Barrel, Cask #5446 – 47.8% ABV - $80**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber +1\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** Banana bread, coconut, cedar chips, allspice, and butterscotch.\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** More banana bread, toasted coconut, black tea leaves, oak.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** Medium.  Brown sugar oakiness, and bananas rolled in cinnamon sugar.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 31 + 30 + 31 =\\n\\n\\n>> **93 / 100**\\n\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** My first Balvenie!  I didn’t really know what to expect, but this is just wonderful.  One dimensional, I guess, but incredibly tasty.   Banana everywhere, but “banana bread” also includes some light nuttiness and sweetness.  This would be a great daily dram, but it’s $150 locally.  My brother picked it up for me in NH for just over half the cost.  \\n\\n\\n#2\\n\\n\\n>**Macallan Sherry Cask Strength – 60.1% ABV - CAD$72**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber +2.5, with sherry redness\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** Dark red berries (cherries & strawberries), with sugar heaped on top.  Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Light, sweet malt.\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** It’s like Christmas.  Spicy honey glaze, strong sherry fruitiness, strawberry rhubarb reduction, and more sweet malt.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** Long.  An up front burst of sherry spiciness, fading slowly intro dried berries and vanilla.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 31 + 32 + 30 =\\n\\n\\n>> **94 / 100**\\n\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** Following the trend, this is also my first Macallan!  But, sherry isn’t really my thing.  I prefer savoury over sweet, generally.  However, the taste here is just outstanding.  I was sure I was in my grandmother’s kitchen at Christmas dinner.   I could drink this for dessert.  \\n\\n#3\\n\\n>**Glenfarclas 105 - 60% ABV - CAD$65**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber +2, with sherry redness\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** Honeyed raisins, poached pear, sweet oranges, allspice, bitter herbs\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** Cherries, clementine orange, white pepper, oak, vanilla.  Strong maltiness.  Black tea.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** Long, with plenty of sherry.  Opens on a burst of mint (!), leading into sweet spices, oak, and mincemeat pie.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 30 + 30 + 31 =\\n\\n\\n>> **92 / 100**\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** My first Glenfarclas!  (I’m sensing a pattern, here…)  Not quite as impressed as I was with the Macallan, but still excellent.  More savoury, less spicy.  This was my dad’s favourite of the evening.  I think I’m just not a fan of the pepper note.  Available for a super good price near me, making this the best price/score scotch.  \\n\\n#4\\n\\n>**Aberlour A’bunadh, batch #36 – 60.1% ABV - CAD$90**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber +2, with sherry redness\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** Brown sugar, buttery toffee, stewed plums and raisins, with plenty of sherry sweetness\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** Opens with a big sherry  burst of heat.  Light white pepper.  Maraschino cherry and sweet orange.  Remarkably similar to the 105, but much more sweet instead of savoury.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** So, this is Christmas.  If Macallan CS finished like this, I’d be in heaven.  Lots of sherry warmth, spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) and a hint of citrus.  Long and warming.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 31 + 30 + 33 =\\n\\n\\n>> **95 / 100**\\n\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** A bit expensive here, but worth every penny.  Split the cost of the bottle three ways with my father and brother.  This was my brother’s pick of the evening.  A matter of taste, really; this was sweet, with just the slightest hint of pepper, putting it over the top of the 105.  I am in love with the finish on this one; my first perfect score in that area.  \\n\\n#5\\n\\n>**Laphroaig Cairdeas Origin (2012 Feis Ile bottling) – 51.2% ABV - CAD$100**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber -2\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** Smoky peat, smoked fish, sea salt, vanilla, a hint of bacon.  None of the expected medicinal notes.  This was the fifth new scotch I nosed in a three hour period, and within seconds I said “Oh my God, this is  amazing.”\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** Should have sent a poet.  I’m sitting in a campfire, and the smoke is in my soul.  A tiny tinge of salt, leather, and vanilla.  Incredibly smooth.  This may be the best thing I have ever tasted.  Absolutely no medicinal notes, which is surprising, but not unwelcome.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** Short sweet burst, followed by medium-long smoke.  Simple, but just plain good.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 33 + 33 + 30 =\\n\\n\\n>> **97 / 100**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** Wow.  Just, wow.  This is amazing.  I knew I would have to do the Laphroaigs last, and my mouth had already been slightly anesthetized by the sherry bombs, but oh lawd, this is good.  It’s liquid smoky gold.  To be safe, we had coffee between the sherry bombs and the Laphroaigs, but regardless, this is easily my top whisky to date.  \\n\\n#6\\n\\n>**Laphroaig Quarter Cask - 48% ABV - CAD$72**\\n\\n\\n>**Colour:** Amber -1.5\\n\\n\\n>**Nose:** The usual Laphroaig peat smoke and medicinal notes, but instead of a punch, it’s a caress; with butter and lemon toning down the harsh peat/medicinal.  Some leather and salted toffeee. Basically, take everything that isn’t smoke/peat/medicine, and amplify it.  A nice change from the 10YO.\\n\\n\\n>**Taste:** Again, not too far from the 10YO, but different flavours come to the front.  Coffee, leather, buttercream, tobacco leaves.\\n\\n\\n>**Finish:** Long, smoky, and warm, fading slowly into bitter oak.\\n\\n\\n>**Score:** 1 + 29 + 29 + 27 =\\n\\n\\n>> **86 / 100**\\n\\n\\n>**Thoughts:** I like it better than the 10YO, but I found it underwhelming after the Cairdeas.\\n\\n\\nAnd there you have it; six scotches, one night.  A lot of fun, but I don’t think I’ll be doing it again.  Five of the six I reviewed are higher than all of my previous scores!  I made a blend of the remnants of the six glasses.  It’s sherry on the nose, but all smoke on the tongue.  The Balvenie bananas are in there, too.  It seemed appropriate, since I was too tipsy to enjoy any of them individually.\\n\\nEdit: Cleaned up the tense and formatting.',\n",
       " \"***Review #2 - Aberlour A'Bunadh - Batch 36***\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Wow, this is a beautiful looking whiskey. Turning it around in  the glass, watching the light refract through it.  Medium caramel gold with a slight copper tinge.  It looks lighter, yet still very rich. I almost don't want to drink it so I can keep staring at it.\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** definitely some alcohol there, but that to be expected of such a strong whiskey.  Smells amazingly sweet, but not in an overbearing way.  Vanilla, butter, and brown sugar make up the majority of the head.  \\n\\n\\nI said earlier that it looked rich, well looks have nothing on the nose here.  I feel like I need to be drinking this on a roundish bed while wearing all velvet.  Unfortunately, the best I can do now is put Crown Royal bags on my feet like slippers.\\n\\n\\nAfter the initial burst, I can smell small bits of cinnamon and nutmeg, and even caramelized apple.  Basically, apple pie nectar of the gods.\\n\\n\\nFinally, I'm picking up some darker fruits and yeast on the end.  It reminds me a lot of dark Belgian beers, specifically, Gulden Draak and Monk's Blood (Belgian brewed with cinnamon).\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Swirling it around, the first thing I notice is how thick it is, almost like nectar.  The liquid strands running down the side are surprisingly thick for a 60% scotch.  Quite strong and vibrant. I can feel it sparkle down my tongue while warming my whole mouth up. Is this the KY of whiskey? This is no doubt due to the strength.  (This is my first cask strength whiskey, by the way). Slightly oily, but far less so than The Lagavulin 16 from my first review.  \\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Mmm, sherry, everywhere.  I first got introduced to sherry casked whiskeys from The Macallan 12, but I enjoyed this richer flavor much more.  The warm butter and brown sugar really flourishes midway through tasting.  I feel like a king drinking this.  It's almost hard to separate flavors as everything is so dense and complex, so I added a bit of water.  Definitely opened it up a lot and allows a rookie like me to pick up on a few new things.  The dark fruit clears up to be raisins, and I'm also noticing a bit of orange zest.\\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Seriously impressed by this. It makes my blanket feel like a hot lady, and my space heater feel like a roaring fireplace.  Something that's definitely new to me is actual changes taking place during the finish.  With most whiskeys I've tried before this (granted, most were junk) but they just faded away with the exact same flavors.  I can feel the Aberlour morph and change the longer I hold it in my mouth.  This kind of complexity is pretty alarming in a good way.\\n\\n\\nI do notice an off taste, though. I can't place it, but it’s familiar.  It's a dry, dusty taste, but beyond that I can't say much more.  I've heard there is some variety in quality between different batches, so this could be the result of that, or the sample container, or the glass I'm using, or just something weird with my tongue today, so I hesitate to knock it too much for this, especially since it's fairly subtle.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** It was nice to try something completely different than The Lagavulin.  I can't say I like one style more than the other, but switching to the near opposite end of the spectrum makes for a great change in sensation.  I did, during this review, take a quick swig of the only other Speyside I had handy, The Glenlivet 12, and it easily surpasses it.  While The Glenlivet tastes fresher and more lively, there's something intoxicating about the the slow sophistication of The Aberlour A'bunadh.  \\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100 (If no aftertaste in subsequent tastings, 92/100)\\n\",\n",
       " \"A joint review with kmallon12. We're kind of new to this so stick with us.\\n\\n**Original cask strength (59.6% ABV)**\\n\\n• Color: Dark red amber\\n\\n• Nose: Strong alcohol and sherry scents\\n\\n• Palate: Very spicy with slight citrus undertones and a hint of honey. A very full bodied and intense flavor filled with lots of sherry, as expected.\\n\\n• Finish: long, warm spices.\\n\\n\\n**Splash of water**\\n\\n• Color: Lighter, obviously\\n\\n• Nose: Mellowed from before\\n\\n• Palate: Opens up a lot. The chocolate and very slight cherry flavors becomes present.\\n\\n• Finish: Still keeps a long warm finish, but calmer. It seems to lose the citrus flavors that were there in the cask strength.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy thoughts: As someone who really enjoys speyside and highland malts I got what I was expecting from this. **A very intense, high quality Scotch**.\\n\\nThis was batch 37.\",\n",
       " \"*Age:* NAS -\\n*ABV:* 59.6 %\\n\\n\\n* **Colour:** Copper/Deep Amber\\n\\n* **Nose:** With almost 60% Alcohol the A'Bunadh needs time to open up of course. Don't rush! Use every angle to sniff this dram. If you simply stick your nose in the middle of the glass you won't get nothing but Alcohol. The Nose is quite powerful but also very sweet. I do not get any off-notes nor significant Sulphur for that matter. The Sherry is there of course but it's not too dominant. Lovely dessert flavours like Crepe Suzette (Warm Pancakes with Butter, Caramel, Orange Zest/Juice and the Orange Liqueur Gran Marnier) and warm Bananas soaked in Rum. But also Malt, Oak, Spices, (Bourbon-like)Vanilla, Nuts, Prunes and Raisins.\\n \\n* **Taste:** The Sherry from the Nose remains and weaves a web around an array of Spices such as Black Pepper, Cardamon, Ginger, Nutmeg and Cloves. All this accompanied by lots of Bourbon Vanilla as well as Oak, Caramel, Dates and hints of Tobacco and Chocolate.\\n \\n* **Finish:** Middle Long and Hot with Sherry, Black Pepper, Vanilla and Rum-Soaked Raisins.\\n\\nI added a spoonful of Water and that reduces the Alcohol of course. The Nose however gets Malty and Buttery and much of the flavour profile is lost. The Palate and Finish become more smooth but less balanced. Still, you can experiment with a couple of drops if you find the Alcohol too strong. Personally I prefer to sip the A'Bunadh neat.\\n\\n**Rating:** 88  \\n\\nNose: 22.5 - Taste: 22 - Finish: 21.5  - Overall: 22\\n\\n\\n**General Remarks:** The A' Bunadh (Gaelic for of the Origin) was recreated in 1975 when Distillery workers found an old bottle of Aberlour from 1898. It is bottled at Cask Strength, Non Chill-Filtered and without adding Caramel for colouring. It matures in good quality Oloroso Sherry Butts.\\n\\n**Drinking Experience Neat:** Very Good\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is a real Powerhouse and a perfect dram for Christmas! I'm living in Brazil for almost 20 years now and sometimes it's difficult to imagine sipping whisky on a Christmas Eve when outside the cold wind is howling and the snow is falling. Right now for instance it's 9.30 in the evening and it's still around 28 degrees Celsius. But even so I'm getting these Christmas images while sipping the A' Bunadh and that says something about the quality of this whisky. And it's still pleasantly priced at around 50 to 60 US Dollars. It helps of course that it's NAS but you don't get that impression while sipping. This could easily pass for a 15 year old in a Blind Tasting in my opinion. Nosing this dram requires patience. At least let it sit in the glass for an hour or so. You will be rewarded with wonderful dessert flavours. The Palate is a balanced combination of Sherry, Spices and Vanilla. The Finish is hot and could have been a bit more subtle. On the whole however this is a well-crafted sherried Speysider that I can fully recommend.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Another in the April GWC series. \\n\\nThis ended the evening of official tastings. There were a couple more drams to come from some bottles on the barrel. But this powerful beast certainly ended the evening with a bang. \\n\\nAberlour A'Bunadh Batch No.37 - No Age Statement - 59.6%\\n\\nColour - Polished Mahogany (1.5)\\n\\nNose - Lots of wood, molasses and muscovado sugar\\n\\nTaste - Big burst of flavour with loads of alcohol behind. But the flavours really show up due to their volume. The roundness of fruit and raisins, along with a big hit of really good tobacco is in here. That sweetness that hits you when you enter a really decent walk-in Humidor. The flavours of sweet tobacco and the wonderful wood is all in here. \\n\\nFinish - Combinations of decent cigars and maple syrup just leave you with a great experience from this wonderful whisky. \\n\\nThis is a classic dram. My telling you that this is a great dram is probably not a surprise. A'Bunadh always seems to deliver unlike some regular released expressions from other distilleries (Arran Icons anyone?). This bottle is definitely worth the 40 quid price tag. You would need to spend triple that price to get this much flavour in another dram. \",\n",

It’s reminiscent of some kind of fruit cake.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Finish:** It’s a delicious dried fruit type of sweetness with a spiced kick. All I can think about after drinking this is the feeling of the end of a thanksgiving dinner at my grandma’s house.

The #39 however is still great and the spices are wonderful if that is what you are looking for. \\n\\nI think the #39 would go great with a sweet dessert where I think the #38 is a dessert in itself!\\n\\nI am now really looking forward to future batches (wherever I can find them anyways).\",\n",

The Aberlour distillery is known for its sherried malts and let’s see if these two expressions live up to the expectations:\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured**\\n\\nAged in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks for 12 years and then married together, this malt should provide a wide spectrum of flavors and character. Bottled at 40% ABV, ~$50 here in NY.\\n\\n**Nose**: Sherried notes hit first, and hard (Don’t even have my nose in the glencairn)! Deep fruits, almost a tangy orange note. The fruits settle down into raspberries and citrus. A floral note comes out after some time in the glass.\\n\\n**Palate**: Nice solid mouthfeel. Slightly oily. Oak notes behind fruity sweetness. Spices develop faintly. Herbs and strawberries develop near the end.\\n\\n**Finish**: Medium-Long. The strawberry stays from the palate. Orange notes fade in and out. A menthol note appears near the end and sums up the finish quite nicely. \\n\\n**Conclusion**: A well-balanced malt, as it seems both cask types suit the spirit well. However, the notes on the palate seem faint compared to the powerful nose on this one. A great beginning dram, but it has some untapped potential. I’m extremely interested in the 12 year, NCF offering, as it might unleash some of this potential.\\n\\n**Score**: 84/100\\n***\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch #39**\\n\\nAged exclusively in ex-Oloroso Sherry butts, bottled at cask strength and non-chill filtered, I’m expecting great things out of this malt after tasting the 12 year Double Cask Matured. I found this older bottling at a small store in Tennessee near my parents home and snatched it up for around $65. It’s bottled at 59.8% ABV.\\n\\n**Nose**: Sherry notes, red currants, red grapes, dates. Berry medley, with distinct strawberry and raspberry notes providing a sweet/sour balance. Candied sugars. Very slight hint of oak. I love this nose. Let’s see if the palate and finish live up to it.\\n\\n**Palate**: Creamy malt. Sherried candies, almost like a blend between strawberries and toffee. Sun-dried raisins. Citrus notes come out. The mouthfeel is jammy, heavy, and thick. The high proof provides a nice tingle, quite like the menthol in the 12 year double cask.\\n\\n**Finish**: A long lasting finish. Cherries come out and blend together with a nice citrus note of lemons and oranges. Sugared rock candies top off the finish with a sublime sweetness.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: A beautiful malt. Hands down one of my favorite malts. The palate tastes a little young with that creamy malt note, but this whisky is crafted around that sweetness. Everything seems sculpted to have a proper place. If something seems too sweet, a tad bit of sourness brings it back into equilibrium. The finish and the palate truly live up to the nose and leave me wanting to come back to this dram and discover if I’ve missed anything (I have!). Truly magnificent.\\n\\n**Score**: 95/100\\n',\n",
       " \"Aberlour A'Bunadh - batches 36, 39, 40, 46\\n\\nBowmore - Devil's Cask batch 1 (re-review)\\n\\nMacAllan - CS\\n\\nWell, after much time and much more time, I've finally gotten to posting up my set of CS Sherry Reviews. Unfortunately, the Batch 36 A'Bunadh is now empty and won't be in the VS section where I sampled them all against each other :( \\n\\nFirst up-- The set of 4 A'Bunadh\\n\\n**Batch 36 - 60.1% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: caramel, strawberry, maraschino cherry, nutmeg?, cinnamon?, chocolate, something I can't quite put my finger on -> maybe fresh pine?\\n\\nAll kinds of delicious coming through here! The sweet, balanced by the spices - fantastic in my books!\\n\\n**Palate**: Strawberry, sweet, very oily and thick feeling. It took me a while to figure what it was that I was missing, but I think it's a sour maraschino cherry note that is coming through in a fantastic way.\\n\\n**Finish**: more strawberry again, spices of cinnamon, and a sweetness that comes through to me as icing sugar, that drying sweetness. \\n\\nAs an overall, I wish I had some more of this left in that open bottle. When it was still available, I did get myself a 2nd so that I can revisit it in the years to come.\\nI ranked this one in at **93**/100\\n\\n**Batch 39 - 59.8% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: candied fruit, lemon grass, salt, cloyingly sweet caramel, oranges, chocolate\\n\\nNo hint of the ABV on the nose, but all kinds of delicious just waiting to be found here in my glass\\n\\n**Palate**: WOW there's the alcohol, unfortunately too overwhelming to really pick out the elements from the nose, I had to press it\\n\\n**Finish**: spices and cranberry\\n\\nExcellent finish, but on the palate, way too much alcohol to pick anything out when it is taken neat.  \\n\\n**Pressed notes**: ~10drops\\n\\nNose: more caramel, more salt, orange\\n\\nPalate: oranges, caramel, spices\\n\\nFinish: spices, caramel, chocolate dryness\\n\\nThis one, **92**/100\\n\\n**Batch 40 - 60.0% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: Sweet!, leather, light spices of a variety I can't place, toffee, Werther's originals, slight hint of high ABV\\n\\n**Palate**: CS!, spicy, oily, chocolate and prunes\\n\\n**Finish**: chocolate, spices -> like a hot apple cider\\n\\nNot as rich a finish or palate as the other 2 above, but still quite good, **88**/100.\\n\\n**Batch 46 - 60.4%**\\n\\n**Nose**: very young - lots of alcohol prevalent here, toffee apple, lemon zest, coca, strawberry, light cinnamon\\n\\n**Palate**: difficult to get passed the alcohol, peppery, ginger, buttery, bing cherry, some cherry as well\\n\\n**Finish**: pepper, drying, strawberries\\n\\nThis one was much noticeably younger than the previous mentions here. So even though it's similar ABV, it was much more apparent than the others, even with a press it was more difficult to pick apart the pieces. Unfortunately, this is definitely the younger brother not measuring up to the others. **80**/100 here.\\n\\n**Macallan CS 1st release - 60.1%**\\n\\nI sampled this one with the Glencairn and the Canadian Glencairn, so a few nosing notes from each of them. For a bit of a change, I put the nosing notes of the Canadian in *italics* along with the Glencairn in regular, just to make things a bit neater. Where I go the same notes, I've indicated with an +.\\n\\n**Nose**: Cherry+, caramel+, some alcohol *slightly more intense with the Canadian*, after a while this turned floral+, *dates*, *nail polish remover*\\n\\nThe cherry note is very strong in this one! With the 2 glasses having about 1oz each, the whole of the room was filled with the smell. Also smelled of apple blossoms after a spring rain throughout the room. Super rich on the nose, very, very intense!\\n\\n**Palate**: feels tingly on the tongue, oily and rich, there's a sweetness to this one to go with the cherries, which are the predominant note here, kind of like an alcoholic cherry danish\\n\\n**Finish**: Cherry, MacIntosh toffee, lasts forever and ever (still had some finish the next morning and yes I brushed my teeth and used mouth wash....), on the breath is like canned cherry juice - delicious!\\n\\nThis was much sharper than some of the A'Bunadhs and in some ways not quite as complex, but with the nose filling the room as it did this is an amazing dram! **94**/100\\n\\n**Bowmore Devil's Cask - 56.9%**\\n\\nThis one is a re-review from quite some time ago when I first started reviewing here. This time around I've used a Canadian Glencairn for the review. I've brought the previous notes along in italics for comparison sake.\\n\\n**Nose**: Musty, caramel, leather, fruity, some alcohol present\\n\\n*unknown fruit, pine? leather, light spice, caramel, some alcohol*\\n\\n**Palate**: Leather, dark fruits, caramel, sweet and musty\\n\\n*smoke, ABV comes through, thick and oily after a bit of time swirling in the mouth, caramel, fruitcake, dark chocolate (90%), tingly on the tongue*\\n\\n**Finish**: musty, fruity, with a long lingering fruit juice note\\n\\n*spices, dried dark fruit, sweet, medium-long*\\n\\nI had previously scored this at a 90, although I think my liking for it has increased. The overall fit and finish for this scotch is fantastic! I would say just as delicious as the A'Bunadh 39.\",\n",
       " \"***Review #2 - Aberlour A'Bunadh - Batch 36***\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Wow, this is a beautiful looking whiskey. Turning it around in  the glass, watching the light refract through it.  Medium caramel gold with a slight copper tinge.  It looks lighter, yet still very rich. I almost don't want to drink it so I can keep staring at it.\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** definitely some alcohol there, but that to be expected of such a strong whiskey.  Smells amazingly sweet, but not in an overbearing way.  Vanilla, butter, and brown sugar make up the majority of the head.  \\n\\n\\nI said earlier that it looked rich, well looks have nothing on the nose here.  I feel like I need to be drinking this on a roundish bed while wearing all velvet.  Unfortunately, the best I can do now is put Crown Royal bags on my feet like slippers.\\n\\n\\nAfter the initial burst, I can smell small bits of cinnamon and nutmeg, and even caramelized apple.  Basically, apple pie nectar of the gods.\\n\\n\\nFinally, I'm picking up some darker fruits and yeast on the end.  It reminds me a lot of dark Belgian beers, specifically, Gulden Draak and Monk's Blood (Belgian brewed with cinnamon).\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Swirling it around, the first thing I notice is how thick it is, almost like nectar.  The liquid strands running down the side are surprisingly thick for a 60% scotch.  Quite strong and vibrant. I can feel it sparkle down my tongue while warming my whole mouth up. Is this the KY of whiskey? This is no doubt due to the strength.  (This is my first cask strength whiskey, by the way). Slightly oily, but far less so than The Lagavulin 16 from my first review.  \\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Mmm, sherry, everywhere.  I first got introduced to sherry casked whiskeys from The Macallan 12, but I enjoyed this richer flavor much more.  The warm butter and brown sugar really flourishes midway through tasting.  I feel like a king drinking this.  It's almost hard to separate flavors as everything is so dense and complex, so I added a bit of water.  Definitely opened it up a lot and allows a rookie like me to pick up on a few new things.  The dark fruit clears up to be raisins, and I'm also noticing a bit of orange zest.\\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Seriously impressed by this. It makes my blanket feel like a hot lady, and my space heater feel like a roaring fireplace.  Something that's definitely new to me is actual changes taking place during the finish.  With most whiskeys I've tried before this (granted, most were junk) but they just faded away with the exact same flavors.  I can feel the Aberlour morph and change the longer I hold it in my mouth.  This kind of complexity is pretty alarming in a good way.\\n\\n\\nI do notice an off taste, though. I can't place it, but it’s familiar.  It's a dry, dusty taste, but beyond that I can't say much more.  I've heard there is some variety in quality between different batches, so this could be the result of that, or the sample container, or the glass I'm using, or just something weird with my tongue today, so I hesitate to knock it too much for this, especially since it's fairly subtle.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** It was nice to try something completely different than The Lagavulin.  I can't say I like one style more than the other, but switching to the near opposite end of the spectrum makes for a great change in sensation.  I did, during this review, take a quick swig of the only other Speyside I had handy, The Glenlivet 12, and it easily surpasses it.  While The Glenlivet tastes fresher and more lively, there's something intoxicating about the the slow sophistication of The Aberlour A'bunadh.  \\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100 (If no aftertaste in subsequent tastings, 92/100)\\n\",\n",

A bit hot for me at around 60%!\\n\\nAdded a dollop of water and thoroughly enjoyed the highland mist build in this dark sherried malt.\\n\\nNose (Water):  A bit more winey with a bouquet of fruits.

Tons of sherried sweetness with cinnamon, cherry cordial, apricot and berries.\\n\\nFinish:  Warm buttered toast with jam.

The cask strength seemed different for a sherry monster at first but as I've had the bottle opened it's really been nice to experiment with different strengths.  The more concentrated notes have more butter and nuttiness that as you dilute it gets fruity and finally quite cinnamony.  Take your time, too.  Closed it's just too buttery with nothing else, and this is lovely for dessert or mingling.  Enjoy!\\n\\nFinal score:  90/100\",\n",

       " 'As promised this is my review to go along with [Mutter’s previous review]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/rtdlc/aberlour_abunadh_batch_39/) a couple days ago. \\n\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 39, 59.8%, $73 USD (includes tax and shipping charges)**\\n\\n**Color:** Rich amber, almost a burgundy color\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet Sherry…. Caramel, Vanilla, some light fruit, Twizzler’s\\n\\n**Taste:** Like most of the other Highland’s I’ve tried the raisin hits me up first.  Not as overpowering as in the Dalmore 12 though… this is better.  Again caramel and vanilla, a nuttiness I can’t quite place, given the nose and the aging exclusively in Sherry casks I expected it to be sweeter but there isn’t much there in sweetness.  Light fruit comes and goes as I let this one spend more time in my mouth, cranberry, so orange-ish perhaps…. Perfume-y scent of flowers… almost like old ladies perfume… you know what I’m talking about… the old women that walk by you in the grocery store and you can actually taste the perfume they have on?  kind of like that.. only not disgusting.  \\uf04a\\n\\n**Finish:** long and smooth.  The raisin revisits at the end with just a hint of the alcohol, followed quickly but an almost burnt vanilla flavor that gives way to slowly dissipating light fruit, no sign of the floral notes in the finish for me.\\n\\n\\n**Scoring**\\n\\n**Taste:** 64/75 – I am not crazy on the raisin but it wasn’t bad\\n\\n**Value:** 7/15 – for what it costs there are much better drams for the same price\\n\\n**Uniqueness:** 2/5 – of all the Highland whisky’s I have had this one fits right in with that same flavor profile, nothing really that jumps out at me\\n\\n**Buy Again:** 1/5 – again, there are much better drams in the same price range\\n\\n**Total:** 74/100\\n\\n\\n**Comments/Thoughts:**  Overall this was a solid dram.  Given its cost it is unlikely I will ever buy it again, but it was good.  It reminded me of the Oban 14 but with a lot more kick and floral notes to it.  I thought for sure it was going to be sweeter than what it was.  The rich color, the Oloroso casks, I was certain it would be sweet… but it just wasn’t.  I don’t in anyway see the comparison of this to the Macallan 12… or even the CS.  It was extremely smooth given the high proof and adding a little bit of filtered water did little for the overall flavor.  The water brought out some of the extra floral notes but that was about it for me… it lost the kick that I thought actually made the whisky good with the water added (I used a pipette so I am fairly certain I didn’t add too much!).  I found this one very drinkable and nice, but as I stated previously, for ~$70 I can get much better bottles. \\n',\n",
       " 'Since I have become such an Aberlour ( mouth of the chattering stream ) fan, I thought I would do a cross expression review.  Two new reviews:  The A’bunadh and the 12 year old Non Chill Filtered, and a link to my previous review of the 12 YO Double Cask.\\n\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh:**  Batch 39, 59.8% ABV, Father’s Day Gift.\\n\\n**Color:**  Amber +2 with a hint of golden orange glow.  Slow thick tears.\\n\\n**Nose:**  Pepper, port wine, raisins, carmel, sweet floral, cocoa, citrus zest.\\n\\n**Mouth Feel/Taste:**  Rich and oily.  Hot, black pepper, sherry, bitter dark chocolate, green leafy vegetative, strawberry jam, raisins.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Warm, dry with more sherry, mincemeat\\n\\n**With Water:**  N:  More pepper, raisins, stronger red wine note.   \\n\\t\\t     T:  The heat is tamed, slight cinnamon candy.\\n\\n**Score:**  Taste: 71, Value: 10, Uniqueness:  5,  Buy Again: 3  **Total:**  89\\n\\nThis is a very intense dram.  A lot of flavor and overall a very good scotch.  A bit spicy due to it’s high ABV but it mellows out nicely with water.  The more time you give it the more it opens.   My chief negative marks are:  no statement on coloring, It’s a little pricy and sometimes hard to find.  Compared to CS Macallan, a bit more rough around the edges and also no age statement, but very much worth purchase for a special event, especially for us sherry scotch fans.  Depending on the day, I could add or subtract an overall point or two.\\n\\n\\n**Aberlour Non Chill Filtered:**  12 yo, 48% ABV, $65 Superior Liquors\\n\\n**Color:**  Amber +2 again with Golden Orange hue.  Thick Tiers, sticks to the glass.\\n\\n**Nose:**  Very balanced, barley malt, Fruit ( red apples) sherry oak cask, red wine, blackberries, cinnamon, coconut.\\n\\n**Mouth Feel/Taste:**  Smooth and balanced, not to heavy or oily.  Warm, smooth, honey, syrup, malt, strawberries, fresh fruit, cinnamon, fennel seed.  \\n\\n**Finish:**  Again well balanced warmth, Sherry comes out more, strawberries and cocoa.\\n\\n**Water:**  N:  Sweet, more fruit and floral\\n\\t       T:   Honey almonds and berries\\n\\n**Score:**  Taste: 73, Value: 12, Unique: 5, Buy Again:4 Total:  94\\nAnd the link for the 12 [Double Cask:](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/sbcgw/aberlour_12_yo_double_cask_yes_another_review_it/)  Just to tie it all together.   \\n\\nIn my opinion and from what I have had to this point, this is one of the best of the sherried Scotch distilleries out there I have tried.  I think they all rank very close (if not better in some cases) to most of the Macallan offerings but often at a better price.  I personally feel this distilleries’ expressions is one of the best values available.  Again my only real complaints lie in if they use coloring, and as tasty as the NCF is compared to the 12 YO Double Cask, I feel they could save time and perhaps money by skipping the filtration.  But hey that’s my 2 cents.  In the meantime I recommend picking up a bottle from this distillery if you have not as of yet.  \\n\\n   ',\n",
       " \"Heavy sherry scotches seem to be of interest, and are a personal favorite at the moment, so I decided to do a side-by-side comparison of the three that I have. This is actually a revisiting of the Aberlour 12 NCF, and a first time review of the A'bunadh and Mac CS. I'll do a quick summary and then a more detailed comparison:\\n\\n---\\n**Aberlour 12 NCF, 48%**\\n\\nColor: Golden with touch of brown\\n\\nBody: Medium viscosity\\n\\nNose: Tannin, Strong wine notes, decent alcohol bite, a little herby\\n\\nTaste: Peppery (white or black), wood notes, citrus, spices, some citrus/wood bitters in a very good way\\n\\nFinish: Pepper again, soft tingles, fades out with the delicious wood/tannin bitters\\n\\n**Rating:**  86\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh batch 39, 59.8%**\\n\\nColor: Browned amber\\n\\nBody: Thick\\n\\nNose: Sweet red fruits, creamy/warm, black forest cake\\n\\nTaste: Very smooth, red peppers, wine/tannin, dried or preserved red fruits\\n\\nFinish: Sherry burst, wood, long warmth, strong mouth tingles leaving the roof of the mouth with a pleasant sweet numbing feeling\\n\\n**Rating:** 89\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Macallan Cask Strength, 59%**\\n\\nColor: Red Amber\\n\\nBody: Thick\\n\\nNose: Huge sweetness, hot/warm, wine sweetness, creamy dark chocolate\\n\\nTaste: Sherry, and sherry. Some sherry, peppery tingles, mouth goes crazy, a lot of notes I can't pick up still\\n\\nFinish: S.h.e.r.r.y, Some wine notes, a bit of wood, red sweetness, citrusy-wood bitters sneaks in, followed by enduring warmth\\n\\n**Rating:** 95\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Side-by-Side**\\n\\nI've been interested in sherried scotches since I first started lurking here. The two that immediately popped out was the Macallan CS, followed by the A'bunadh. I wanted the CS, but rumors were already flying around about it getting the ax then so I was worried about getting attached, and though the a'bunadh would suffice, which was what a lot of people suggested. The 12 NCF also got high recommendations. \\n\\nReally, these are 3 subtely different takes on a sherried scotch, but it makes them all the better for it. The 12 NCF hits sherry with the nose, with herby-wine notes, but the taste and finish deliver something completely different, and deliciously so. The A'bunadh gives more of the herb-wine nose, but with far more sweetness and creaminess, and also follows up with a very smooth sweet sherried taste with fruits. The Macallan CS, it just runs with the sherry. The 12 NCF toys with it, the A'bunadh gives it a solid hit, but the Macallan CS has easily made sherry its life-pursuit, twisting sherry to give notes that the other two just can't deliver on. It's why I had such a hard time nailing down notes with the Mac CS, since while the sherry was super strong, I could tell there were so many things going on underneath that would pop up and then change into something else very rapidly. \\n\\nIn short, the 12 NCF shows it's in the club, but presents plenty of other character, showing its diversity. The A'bunadh is what I picture a text-book sherried scotch to be, fruity, red, and some spice. The Mac CS takes the cake by giving notes that I never thought came with sherry, truly unique and I'll be sad to see it go.\\n\\nI'm finishing up college so my ratings sort of reflect that mentality. The Aberlour 12 NCF is a solid B, with great execution, I've found that this revisit has actually raised my opinion of it. The A'bunadh deserves the highest B+, but hasn't quite given me a reason to bring it up into the A range, it hasn't surprised me yet. The Macallan CS its a strong A, it certainly isn't revolutionary enough to get anything 97 or higher, but it is definitely the most interesting scotch I've had so far.\",\n",

Creamy caramel and chocolate aftertaste with an intense heat. \\n\\n----\\n**Score and Remarks:**\\n90/100: At cask strength, this was almost too much for me. Drinking this neat, all I could taste was sherry and alcohol, essentially. But wow, was it good. Intense, full of sherry flavor and spice. A real eye opener. Adding 3 teaspoons of room-temp filtered water opened up the dram quite a bit. It becomes a lovingly playful scotch – bright and merry with cheery citrus, apple and pear notes, chock full of strong sherry flavor. It concludes with a lingering and enjoyable heat, hints of caramel, and notes of chocolate and cream. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"On a recent trip to New Zealand I tried the Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #38 with dinner and was fairly impressed. I knew I had a bottle at home, but couldn't recall what batch it was.\\n\\nWhen I did get home I was somewhat disappointed to see that I had Batch #39 and on trying a quick sample it wasn't the whisky I remembered. \\n\\nSo I managed to convince someone to pick me up a bottle in NZ and bring it back to Australia for me and I took delivery this morning. Was going to wait for the weekend, but when the other half asked for some whisky I thought this was a perfect opportunity to do a face off!\\n\\n---\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #38**\\n\\nSpeyside\\n\\n60.3% ABV\\n\\n**Colour:** Dark Amber\\n\\n**Nose:** Raisins, red grapes, chocolate, vanilla, sweet caramel, creme brulee \\n\\n**Taste:** Starts with a quick bite of cinnamon that quickly fades into a smooth mouth feel despite the high alcohol content. I get raisins, raspberries, double cream and a warm chocolate fondant.\\n\\n**Finish:** A long smooth, warm finish with toffee, chocolate cake and raisins.\\n\\n**Overall:** This is a wonderful whisky! I tend to find that the non Islay whiskies fail to deliver on promising noses and usually have a bland finish. This A'bunadh on the other hand delivers everywhere. Fantastic.\\n\\n>90/100\\n\\n- - - \\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #39**\\n\\nSpeyside\\n\\n59.8% ABV\\n\\n**Colour:** Dark Amber\\n\\n**Nose:** Raisins, nutmeg, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate \\n\\n**Taste:** Spices galore with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Reminds me of ginger biscuits with under currents of raisins and berries.\\n\\n**Finish:** A medium long finish with the spices coming through again, mostly cinnamon and ginger. Fades to raisins and berries. May not appear to last quite as long because of the initial spice hit that then fades away, but you can still taste hints of raisins for quite a while afterwards.\\n\\n**Overall:** A great whisky that hints in the nose of the spice that it is about to deliver on the palate.\\n\\n>84/100\\n\\n- - -\\n**In Comparison**\\n\\nIt is strange how different these whiskies are when they have the same name. The nose is fairly similar with it being difficult to tell them apart except that the #39 has stronger spice and caramel notes to it.\\n\\nThe taste however is radically different. \\n\\nThe #38 is decadent! So smooth despite the high ABV with a wonderful balance between delicate spices and sweet, creamy flavours. \\n\\nThe #39 on the other hand is a spice bomb and feels like it has more of a kick despite it having slightly less alcohol.\\n\\nThe finishes follow the tastes fairly closely and as you can tell from the scores I do prefer the flavour profile of the #38 (as does the other half). The #39 however is still great and the spices are wonderful if that is what you are looking for. \\n\\nI think the #39 would go great with a sweet dessert where I think the #38 is a dessert in itself!\\n\\nI am now really looking forward to future batches (wherever I can find them anyways).\",\n",
       " 'Hi Everyone!\\n\\nI\\'m new to this sub, so I thought I\\'d share some thoughts on the Aberlour \"A\\'Bunadh\" Speyside Single Malt for my first attempt at \\'mini\\' review. I hope you enjoy it as much as I am this beautiful dram! :)\\n\\nAs a non-chill filtered cask-strength whisky (~60% vol), the A\\'Bunadh is definitely for the more adventurous/robust palate.\\n\\nThe Alcohol can be overwhelming at first, but if you can make it past the sensation you are rewarded with full-bodied honey and maple flavours on the tongue, then unmistakable intense spice flavour explodes into what can only be described as Christmas pudding rich in spice and oak; finally developing into a long and smooth biscuit after taste, and finishing with just the barest flash of sweetness. The depth and levels of flavour are definitely enhanced by adding a very conservative splash of water before drinking.\\n\\nAt Au$109, it is not cheap, but I highly recommend it to the adventurous whisky drinker who is after a BIG whisky with plenty of fight!\\n\\n\\nSláinte!',\n",
       " \"Aberlour A'Bunadh - batches 36, 39, 40, 46\\n\\nBowmore - Devil's Cask batch 1 (re-review)\\n\\nMacAllan - CS\\n\\nWell, after much time and much more time, I've finally gotten to posting up my set of CS Sherry Reviews. Unfortunately, the Batch 36 A'Bunadh is now empty and won't be in the VS section where I sampled them all against each other :( \\n\\nFirst up-- The set of 4 A'Bunadh\\n\\n**Batch 36 - 60.1% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: caramel, strawberry, maraschino cherry, nutmeg?, cinnamon?, chocolate, something I can't quite put my finger on -> maybe fresh pine?\\n\\nAll kinds of delicious coming through here! The sweet, balanced by the spices - fantastic in my books!\\n\\n**Palate**: Strawberry, sweet, very oily and thick feeling. It took me a while to figure what it was that I was missing, but I think it's a sour maraschino cherry note that is coming through in a fantastic way.\\n\\n**Finish**: more strawberry again, spices of cinnamon, and a sweetness that comes through to me as icing sugar, that drying sweetness. \\n\\nAs an overall, I wish I had some more of this left in that open bottle. When it was still available, I did get myself a 2nd so that I can revisit it in the years to come.\\nI ranked this one in at **93**/100\\n\\n**Batch 39 - 59.8% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: candied fruit, lemon grass, salt, cloyingly sweet caramel, oranges, chocolate\\n\\nNo hint of the ABV on the nose, but all kinds of delicious just waiting to be found here in my glass\\n\\n**Palate**: WOW there's the alcohol, unfortunately too overwhelming to really pick out the elements from the nose, I had to press it\\n\\n**Finish**: spices and cranberry\\n\\nExcellent finish, but on the palate, way too much alcohol to pick anything out when it is taken neat.  \\n\\n**Pressed notes**: ~10drops\\n\\nNose: more caramel, more salt, orange\\n\\nPalate: oranges, caramel, spices\\n\\nFinish: spices, caramel, chocolate dryness\\n\\nThis one, **92**/100\\n\\n**Batch 40 - 60.0% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: Sweet!, leather, light spices of a variety I can't place, toffee, Werther's originals, slight hint of high ABV\\n\\n**Palate**: CS!, spicy, oily, chocolate and prunes\\n\\n**Finish**: chocolate, spices -> like a hot apple cider\\n\\nNot as rich a finish or palate as the other 2 above, but still quite good, **88**/100.\\n\\n**Batch 46 - 60.4%**\\n\\n**Nose**: very young - lots of alcohol prevalent here, toffee apple, lemon zest, coca, strawberry, light cinnamon\\n\\n**Palate**: difficult to get passed the alcohol, peppery, ginger, buttery, bing cherry, some cherry as well\\n\\n**Finish**: pepper, drying, strawberries\\n\\nThis one was much noticeably younger than the previous mentions here. So even though it's similar ABV, it was much more apparent than the others, even with a press it was more difficult to pick apart the pieces. Unfortunately, this is definitely the younger brother not measuring up to the others. **80**/100 here.\\n\\n**Macallan CS 1st release - 60.1%**\\n\\nI sampled this one with the Glencairn and the Canadian Glencairn, so a few nosing notes from each of them. For a bit of a change, I put the nosing notes of the Canadian in *italics* along with the Glencairn in regular, just to make things a bit neater. Where I go the same notes, I've indicated with an +.\\n\\n**Nose**: Cherry+, caramel+, some alcohol *slightly more intense with the Canadian*, after a while this turned floral+, *dates*, *nail polish remover*\\n\\nThe cherry note is very strong in this one! With the 2 glasses having about 1oz each, the whole of the room was filled with the smell. Also smelled of apple blossoms after a spring rain throughout the room. Super rich on the nose, very, very intense!\\n\\n**Palate**: feels tingly on the tongue, oily and rich, there's a sweetness to this one to go with the cherries, which are the predominant note here, kind of like an alcoholic cherry danish\\n\\n**Finish**: Cherry, MacIntosh toffee, lasts forever and ever (still had some finish the next morning and yes I brushed my teeth and used mouth wash....), on the breath is like canned cherry juice - delicious!\\n\\nThis was much sharper than some of the A'Bunadhs and in some ways not quite as complex, but with the nose filling the room as it did this is an amazing dram! **94**/100\\n\\n**Bowmore Devil's Cask - 56.9%**\\n\\nThis one is a re-review from quite some time ago when I first started reviewing here. This time around I've used a Canadian Glencairn for the review. I've brought the previous notes along in italics for comparison sake.\\n\\n**Nose**: Musty, caramel, leather, fruity, some alcohol present\\n\\n*unknown fruit, pine? leather, light spice, caramel, some alcohol*\\n\\n**Palate**: Leather, dark fruits, caramel, sweet and musty\\n\\n*smoke, ABV comes through, thick and oily after a bit of time swirling in the mouth, caramel, fruitcake, dark chocolate (90%), tingly on the tongue*\\n\\n**Finish**: musty, fruity, with a long lingering fruit juice note\\n\\n*spices, dried dark fruit, sweet, medium-long*\\n\\nI had previously scored this at a 90, although I think my liking for it has increased. The overall fit and finish for this scotch is fantastic! I would say just as delicious as the A'Bunadh 39.\",\n",
       " \"Hi /r/Scotch, while I've amassed a small [collection](http://imgur.com/I6d4XB0) over the last 3 years,  only within the last year did I start understanding and learning more about single malts and what goes into making them.  I first started from the Glenfiddich 12 and slowly moved to Aberlour (12DC, A'bunadh)/Glendronach (15yo Revival).  Though recently I've expanded and tried the Laphroaig Quarter Cask, this first review is for one of my favourite Aberlour expressions - the A'bunadh.\\n\\nNote: The review was done neat, w/o any water added.\\n\\n**Color**: Dark orangey-reddish Amber\\n\\n**Nose**: This makes me think of a rich fruitcake, the kind made with alcohol in it.  Raisins, figs and a slight hint of maple syrup come to mind.  I've not tried an actual sherry to date, so I can't say for sure on sherry notes.\\n\\n**Taste**: Ooof, the sweet sweet notes of maple syrup on a chewy fruitcake!  Again, plenty of dried fruits come forth but with ~70% cacao dark chocolate coming in next.  It also gets spicy, cinnamon maybe? This stuff is amazing, its like eating dark chocolate with fruitcake - something I enjoy once a year.  The spice has an interesting kick too.\\n\\n**Finish**: Warm burn of a medium length, the dark chocolate notes become more pronounced (~85% cacao), but complement and enhance the sweetness from the dram.  Cinnamon notes more certain, but still subtle and in the background.  Extremely addictive and makes me want to come back for more. \\n\\nThis is one of my favourite bottles, (admittedly having a sweet tooth) the sweetness is what initially attracted me to this ram.  However, the spice and notes of dark chocolate slowly reeled me in hook, line and sinker!  I hope you all enjoyed the review!\\n\\nEDIT: Typos and formatting\",\n",
       " \"***Review #2 - Aberlour A'Bunadh - Batch 36***\\n\\n\\n**Color:** Wow, this is a beautiful looking whiskey. Turning it around in  the glass, watching the light refract through it.  Medium caramel gold with a slight copper tinge.  It looks lighter, yet still very rich. I almost don't want to drink it so I can keep staring at it.\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** definitely some alcohol there, but that to be expected of such a strong whiskey.  Smells amazingly sweet, but not in an overbearing way.  Vanilla, butter, and brown sugar make up the majority of the head.  \\n\\n\\nI said earlier that it looked rich, well looks have nothing on the nose here.  I feel like I need to be drinking this on a roundish bed while wearing all velvet.  Unfortunately, the best I can do now is put Crown Royal bags on my feet like slippers.\\n\\n\\nAfter the initial burst, I can smell small bits of cinnamon and nutmeg, and even caramelized apple.  Basically, apple pie nectar of the gods.\\n\\n\\nFinally, I'm picking up some darker fruits and yeast on the end.  It reminds me a lot of dark Belgian beers, specifically, Gulden Draak and Monk's Blood (Belgian brewed with cinnamon).\\n\\n\\n**Body:** Swirling it around, the first thing I notice is how thick it is, almost like nectar.  The liquid strands running down the side are surprisingly thick for a 60% scotch.  Quite strong and vibrant. I can feel it sparkle down my tongue while warming my whole mouth up. Is this the KY of whiskey? This is no doubt due to the strength.  (This is my first cask strength whiskey, by the way). Slightly oily, but far less so than The Lagavulin 16 from my first review.  \\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Mmm, sherry, everywhere.  I first got introduced to sherry casked whiskeys from The Macallan 12, but I enjoyed this richer flavor much more.  The warm butter and brown sugar really flourishes midway through tasting.  I feel like a king drinking this.  It's almost hard to separate flavors as everything is so dense and complex, so I added a bit of water.  Definitely opened it up a lot and allows a rookie like me to pick up on a few new things.  The dark fruit clears up to be raisins, and I'm also noticing a bit of orange zest.\\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Seriously impressed by this. It makes my blanket feel like a hot lady, and my space heater feel like a roaring fireplace.  Something that's definitely new to me is actual changes taking place during the finish.  With most whiskeys I've tried before this (granted, most were junk) but they just faded away with the exact same flavors.  I can feel the Aberlour morph and change the longer I hold it in my mouth.  This kind of complexity is pretty alarming in a good way.\\n\\n\\nI do notice an off taste, though. I can't place it, but it’s familiar.  It's a dry, dusty taste, but beyond that I can't say much more.  I've heard there is some variety in quality between different batches, so this could be the result of that, or the sample container, or the glass I'm using, or just something weird with my tongue today, so I hesitate to knock it too much for this, especially since it's fairly subtle.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** It was nice to try something completely different than The Lagavulin.  I can't say I like one style more than the other, but switching to the near opposite end of the spectrum makes for a great change in sensation.  I did, during this review, take a quick swig of the only other Speyside I had handy, The Glenlivet 12, and it easily surpasses it.  While The Glenlivet tastes fresher and more lively, there's something intoxicating about the the slow sophistication of The Aberlour A'bunadh.  \\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100 (If no aftertaste in subsequent tastings, 92/100)\\n\",\n",
       " \"Greetings, fellow Scotchiteers! So, for a bit of a change of pace, I'll be reviewing an unpeated whisky. I've been disappointed enough times by unpeated whiskies that I tend not to go for them that often, but the ranting and raving on Scotchit eventually convinced me to buy this a few months back.\\n\\nI am, of course, talking about **Aberlour a'Bunadh**, specifically Batch 40. Apparently not a great batch according to Ralfy, but I don't have much to compare it to, so let's just see.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Review #38: Aberlour a'Bunadh Batch 40**  \\n*Speyside, 60% ABV, no age statement, natural colour, un-chill-filtered*\\n\\n**Nose**: oak tannins, rye spices, dark fruits, brown sugar, dry sherry, ripe oranges  \\n*With water*: more fruits, less spice, more sherry\\n\\nDark and foreboding. I'm reminded a lot of Rittenhouse Rye - it has that same woody spiciness and punch. Hiding just underneath it is a tinge of dark fruits, like a Christmas orange (an orange with dozens of whole cloves stuck into it, for those not in the know). \\n\\n**Taste**: thick, oily and hot mouthfeel, charred oak, sherry spices, fruity sweetness, oaky vanilla, brown sugar, cloves, orange citrus, mild cherry, dark chocolate  \\n*With water*: much smoother and sweeter, delicious spiciness\\n\\nThe arrival on this is dark and spicy, but holding it on your tongue for just a while opens it up and lets the sweetness and vanilla shine through. Quite nice, overall. The cask strength of this makes the mouthfeel gorgeously thick, but also contributes to an almost overwhelming amount of heat. I'd recommend adding a relatively generous amount of water - it can take it, and what emerges is a beautifully sweet and spicy sherried whisky.\\n\\n**Finish**: long and warming, ginger and cloves, mild oak tannins, sherry sweetness, orange juice glaze, vanilla, very mild bitterness\\n\\nThis tends to be the bit I dread when drinking sherried whiskies. If it's even slightly bitter on the palate, it tends to blow me out of the water with bitterness on the finish. However, this is really nice. It's warming and spicy, with enough length and variety to keep you feeling pretty satisfied with yourself for quite some time. \\n\\n**Conclusion**: A beast of a whisky. The cask strength, NCF and natural colouring all contribute to what, in my opinion, is one of the finest sherried whiskies in existence. Where most sherried Scotch leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, this has almost none, allowing you to keep sipping away. Water is almost mandatory - if someone out there is able to drink this neat, I applaud them, because at 60%, that is no small feat. \\n\\nBasically, I might have to keep one of these bottles around. That's saying a hell of a lot, coming from me. Well done, Aberlour, great stuff.\\n\\n**Score**: 92/100  \\n*A classic.*\",\n",

       " \"**Aberlour Mega-Review** (#5,6,7,8)\\n\\nI am a huge fan of the sherried malts. The Aberlour 12 Double Cask was one of the first *good* scotches that I had the pleasure of receiving as a gift. It lifted me out of the Dewar's and Cutty Sark gutters I was laying in. For this reason Aberlour has a special place on my shelf (also a very meaningful gift). I decided to explore the Aberlour series as best as I could given Oregon's lack of selection. I finally got around to buying another bottle of NCF to do a proper review. The following is my experience with the Aberlour 12, 16, A'bunadh #40, and the amazing 12 NCF.\\n\\n\\n\\nReviews not done in one sitting. Left to rest for ~15-20 minutes before nosing or tasting. All taken neat except the A'bunadh.\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Double Cask Matured 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep Amber.\\n* **Nose:** Sherry, fruit--apple, hint of orange peel.\\n* **Taste:** Heavy Honey. Fruits, pears, apples and then fades (or is it overtaken?) into a peppery spice.\\n* **Finish:** Nothing too crazy. Medium Length. Sugary apples fading out to leave a huge pepper taste. Not a great finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe regular 12yr blew me away when I first had it. Now that I have had some time to really find my palate it doesn't seem *as* compelling. It is still a great dram for the price, and I will likely always stock it. But it isn't balanced too well -- especially in the finish.\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 16yr 43% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** Add some ruby to the 12yr.\\n* **Nose:** *Very* similar to the 12yr. Seems like it has picked up some more vanilla or toffee notes though.\\n* **Taste:** Very smooth. The pepper has lost its overpowering kick here. The woody/oaky elements come out more with the extra aging. Hints of that vanilla like a bourbon.\\n* **Finish:** Just a better finish than the 12yr. More robust sherry with the vanilla that steps aside slowly for the pepper to creep in to leave a warm longer finish.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent example of how a scotch can benefit from more time in the cask. It basically just took all the rough edges of that 12yr and smoothed them out to just build a better whisky from the same excellent foundation.\\n\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #40 60% w/water**\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep deep red amber.\\n* **Nose:** The high ABV gave me some trouble here. I got big sherry notes (obviously). Oranges. Earthy/woody notes.\\n* **Taste:** It is almost as if someone took a dried fruit medley (prunes, dates, raisins etc) and just removed most of the sugar. You get huge fruity notes without the overpowering sweetness that would come along with it. Nutty flavors slide in and out. A peppery finish lingers behind all of this.\\n* **Finish:** Very long and warm. Transitions nicely from the complex fruit flavors into that warm hazelnut pepper. And then right when you think its going to fade you get the oaky flavors coming back.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had to drink this a few times and experiment with the water to figure out how to really enjoy this one. Drinking it neat is just murder on your taste buds and nose. Too much water and you lose too much character and its bores you. Once I found the sweet spot it became one of my favorites. I just wish I could try more batches (maybe that infamous #38).\\n\\n**92/100**\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________\\n\\n**Aberlour 12yr Non Chill-Filtered 48% Neat**\\n\\n* **Color:** In my dim light a nice red honey.\\n* **Nose:** Powerful sherry, raisins, dark chocolate.\\n* **Taste:** All the fruit. Seriously. Sherry with a hint of citrus. Raisins, fresh cherry, dates, prunes? There is definitely a nutty element here as well. Possible almond or hazelnut. It is fairly sweet with a touch of honey. \\n* **Finish:** This finish is solid. It isn't crazy long but it is exceptionally balanced. The fruits fade slowly to reveal a lingering sherry and spice and balance perfectly. The higher ABV keeps you warm throughout.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the winner of the lineup. The flavors might not be as pronounced as the A'bunadh but they just play off each other so much better. It is slightly more expensive than the normal 12yr which makes it an easy buy for the exceptional craft you get. I have a hard time believing this is the same 12yr just not filtered. If that is truly the case I am appalled they would tarnish so much scotch in the name of filtration. I am really disappointed this is [allegedly] being discontinued.\\n\\n**96/100**\",\n",
       " \"Speyside. Single malt. 60% ABV.\\n\\n* **color:** Dark amber.\\n* **nose:** Sherry. Orange peel. Brown sugar. Cloves. \\n* **palate:** Big flavor. Sherry and spice and everything nice. Hint of vanilla.\\n* **finish:** Long-lasting. Lingering sweetness that transitions into a nice bitter woodiness. A little burn, but very smooth for 60%.\\n\\nScore: 86/100\\n\\nYou know it. You love it. I'm not a huge sherry head but I can appreciate this and I love that it's cask strength.

       " \"Hello fellow malt heads, today I've got some notes about my time spent with Aberlour last night while I caught up on some UFC (162 - Roger Gracie's debut). It's been particularly warm (88 degrees!) in my area over the past week and so I brought out my Aberlour samples and my tasting journal and wrote up some notes while I enjoyed some MMA. Organizing my notes this morning while rocking out to some Queens of the Stone Age.\\n\\nAfter my first expression from Aberlour with the 12 year old Double Cask Matured I was eager to sit down with the flag-ship expressions (A'Bunadh and 12NCF). I figured I should taste them all in order to get a good feel for their spirit from start to finish. Here are my tasting notes from the night and one extra set of notes from back in June during a group tasting with a friend who brought his bottle of A'Bunadh Batch #30, Yum! Cheers\\n\\n----\\n\\n[Previous Review notes of **Aberlour 12 Double Cask**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1gqqol/aberlour_12_double_cask_matured_speyside_single/camtv6c) - This was my Review #31\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *43%* \\n\\n- **Price** $40 - 750ml bottle\\n  \\n**[Tasted Neat](http://i.imgur.com/Dz3ZsVS.jpg)** - [Pictured here on the right](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)\\n\\n- **Color:** Deep Amber, Liquid Copper\\n\\n- **Nose:** Very faint sherry influence, red apple, slight burn, orange pith, touch of vanilla, upfront medicinal alcoholic wall. *A simple barely sweet and bitter slightly burn-y nose that leaves you searching but comes up short before the alcohol*\\n\\n- **Taste:**  Watery-light oily, soft intro, light citrus, sour fruit, warms and thickens to a hot spiciness, pepper, astringent. *Not very impressed with the palate here, very lacking and somewhat in-line with the simple nose*\\n\\n- **Finish:**  Peppered apple, sour citrus, hot and fast on the palate, fades leaving a pepper flavor and a zing of light burnt sugar. *A quick hot finish of citrus, apple and pepper with a light toffee trail*\\n\\n**Summary** \\nWell, this feels like very young spirit to me, I was expecting a bit more sherry and oak in this to be honest but it was a pretty shallow nose. I hit a few fruits and slight sherry and then a brick wall of medicinal alcoholic vapor. The palate was anti-climactic, watery to light oily, hot and sour and peppery, into a finish of the same apple, pepper, citrus that trails off into a weak toffee flavor.\\n\\n**72/100** \\n*This one was a complete miss for me, didn't enjoy any part of it really. Money is better spent elsewhere imo. I think I'm coming to find out I'm not a fan of super peppery malts and blends*\\n\\n**Update:** Now that I've had the big hitters from Aberlour I feel this original score was a bit harsh as I know the destination this malt is going for. After my tasting last night I would probably bump it up to **79/100**. It's not a terrible malt, but not amazing either. It really loses a lot of the flavor profile with the chill-filtering, this is a great example of what that process does to single malt. Still not a fan.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Review #57**\\n----\\n\\n**Aberlour 12 Non-chillfiltered** Speyside Single Malt - ABV *48%*  \\n\\n**[Enjoyed Neat](http://i.imgur.com/3RKM7GB.jpg)** - Middle glass\\n\\n- **Price** $60 - 750ml bottle \\n\\n- **Color:** Light Amber hue, Un-filtered honey\\n\\n- **Nose:** Sherry oak, strawberry preserves, salty, honey, almonds, marzipan, fresh river air, airy sense, damp forest, pleasantly complex\\n\\n- **Taste:** Sweet Bursting sherry, berry pie filling, warm spices, sweetness, sherry oak, thickens and warms, slight orange peel note, medium oily, complex - Full bodied and pleasantly oily mouth feel.\\n\\n- **Finish:** Dark fruits, great oak flavor and some almonds, a little peppery with faint notes of oranges, warm long finish that is smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n**Summary**  \\nA huge improvement over the standard 12 year expression. The complexity has been doubled here guys, the NCF is a very nice Speysider. I could see getting a full bottle of this one, they've really hit the sweet spot of their spirit in this expression.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the palate and finish most on this dram, the nose is definitely enjoyable too but the flavors here are what hooked me.

Long finish that continues with those big fruity notes until it dries out.\\n\\n- **Taste:** Blast of fig, berries and sherry along with vanilla cremes, almond and pie crust with dusted cinnamon spice and sweet oak.\\n\\n- **Finish:** Hot, powerful and delicious! Succulent dark fruits like boysenberry jam or blackberry cobbler, notes of dark chocolate and pepper with oak underneath. \\n\\n**Summary**  \\nThis was my first Cask Strength sherry bomb experience and it was a great one. I remember this one being a little better than the Batch #40 below It seemed to have more of those deep sherry and fruity flavors than the the Batch #40 and is just a few points higher for me. It's definitely cool to see that there are differences batch to batch, keeping a consistent product seems like witchcraft in Whisky so I don't fault them at all.

There is a slight bitter note on the palate this time and the palate is just slightly less impressive this time around. Not sure if it is due to the different batches but it seems thats a possibility. This is still a GREAT whisky, I just remember the Batch #30 being so much more flavorful and better experience. Still glad to have had a sample of this!

Personally, I would pick up a bottle of the Non-chill filtered 12 year old at this point. It's a really solid Speyside dram for the price.\\n\\nCheers\\n\",\n",
       " 'With all the travel I’ve been doing for work, its been keeping me from being able to do much in the way of reviewing anything. That is, until I realized I had all of these sample bottles I could fill up and take with me.

Nutmeg and cloves. Raisins.\\n\\n**Finish:** Warm and big. A little bit of bitter wood. Plenty of that sherry taste. A little maple, and some walnut.\\n\\n**Overall:** Quite delicious. I like this slightly more than the Macallan I had, but they’re both great. It definitely solidifies my like of high proof offerings. Its a shame that they seem to be much harder to find in scotch than they are in bourbon.\\n\\nOne thing I found interesting is that the taste reminded me quite a lot of a raisin ham recipe we used to have all the time growing up. I think the next time we make that, I’ll try adding a splash of this to the sauce.\\n\\n**Rating: 91 (Extremely Good)**\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a side note, this was the scotch which finished off the tasting, not the Laphroaig Quarter Cask like I was expecting. I had ordered them with this as the 4th, and the Laphroaig as the 5th, but after this one everyone was fairly done. Apparently giving new whisky drinkers cask strength stuff, even a half ounce of it, wasn’t such a great idea.\\n',\n",

Glenfarclas was definitely out at first glance, but the A’bunadh looks great. Voluptuous even. But in the end, there’s something about that classy, elegant, graceful tall Macallan bottle design. You can never actually appreciate a Macallan bottle until you hold it in your hands and feel the nice weight of the glass and scotch with it’s almost invisible upward curve as it looks fairly normal in ads and afar. Macallan went to school because, boy, it has class.\\n\\n**Color:** No doubt about it as this (http://i.imgur.com/yGK8XAw.jpg more whiskyporn in the album boys!) photo proves, the Macallan is the deepest, darkest of them all in front of a white light. It’s ruby deep it’s like a red wine. The a’bunadh(rightmost) is second with a red hue and the Glenfarclas 105 almost looks like a normal long aged scotch in ex-bourbon cask. \\n\\n(Shoutout to /u/trexid for suggesting the use of backlight.) \\n\\n**TL;DR:**\\n\\n**Macallan CS - 92/100**\\n\\n**Glenfarclas 105 - 90/100**\\n\\n**Aberlour A’Bunadh #41 - 88/100**\\n\\nMacallan wins, the richness and tidal wave of flavours after flavours cannot be beat. It was also the highest proofed one of the verticals but even neat the alcohol didn\\'t come out for the worse, I think this might have been the most mature one, or blended with more older stock. The Gelnfarclas was also very very good, no alcohol harshness like the Macallan at almost the same proof, it has a more understated richness and a more lighter fruitiness reminiscent of bourbons, I can sip this one all night, I love it’s clean and crisp finish almost just as much as Macallan’s rich and long one. Lastly, A’bunadh places third in my ranking but still a pretty high score. This one was just felt younger than all of them, you can detect more young wood flavours that holds the potential of greater chocolate/coffee hints if aged longer. Maybe I should get a different batch down the road, I hear each batch can be widely different. \\n\\nWith all their sherriness, I still found each one to be uniquely different. I enjoyed them all although I was a bit disappointed by the A’bunadh performance relative to the other two. I have a few Macallan CS stockpiled, i’ll probably get a 105 down the line as I’ve found out a few places where it’s actually the cheapest of all these sherry CS, i’ll skip a few batches of a’bunadh until a review pops up of a really good one. That said, I wish Glendronach would up their distribution of their Cask Strength already! Would\\'ve been a nice #10 to get some tartan.',\n",

This kind of complexity is pretty alarming in a good way.\\n\\n\\nI do notice an off taste, though. I can't place it, but it’s familiar.  It's a dry, dusty taste, but beyond that I can't say much more.  I've heard there is some variety in quality between different batches, so this could be the result of that, or the sample container, or the glass I'm using, or just something weird with my tongue today, so I hesitate to knock it too much for this, especially since it's fairly subtle.\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** It was nice to try something completely different than The Lagavulin.  I can't say I like one style more than the other, but switching to the near opposite end of the spectrum makes for a great change in sensation.  I did, during this review, take a quick swig of the only other Speyside I had handy, The Glenlivet 12, and it easily surpasses it.  While The Glenlivet tastes fresher and more lively, there's something intoxicating about the the slow sophistication of The Aberlour A'bunadh.  \\n\\n\\n**Rating:** 87/100 (If no aftertaste in subsequent tastings, 92/100)\\n\",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh (Batch 42) - Highland Single Malt - Cask Strength 60.5% ABV - $60 (USD)**\\n\\nGreetings again, Scotchiteers!\\n\\nBack with a review (my third. btw) of the mighty Aberlour A'bunadh, a strong sherried beast of a whisky.  \\n\\n**color** red-brown, almost copper\\n  \\n**nose:** dry, nose-tingling sherry, dried fruits & oak.  it's complexity is almost masked by it's strength until you add a few drops of water (which you'll definitely want to do.)  notes of vanilla and maple start to come through given enough time.\\n\\n**palate** spicey toungue-numbing sherry.  lot of sherry, actually (notice a theme yet?) a little nutty, vanilla, and citrusy apple (i know it's almost oxymoronic, but it's the best way I can describe it.) it's very strong, yet creamy at the same time.  like with the nose, the palate opens up more with time and water and takes on a hint of smoke and oak. \\n\\n**finish**  smooth, strong, and lingering. makes you feel like your're beathing delicious sweet fire for a good 20-30 seconds, even longer if sipped neat (which I did only one or twice for the sake of this review.)\\n\\n**Rating:  89/100**\\n\\nthis was my first cask strength whisky, and it's most definitely strong as damn.  Delicious, but very strong.  Bear in mind that I'm still relatively new to scotch, so it might not be so strong to others, but to me...heat.  but, it's a very smooth heat, which makes it quite enjoyable.  With the right amount of water, it's probably one of the finest I've had, and one that I'll enjoy (very slowly) for some time. \\n\\nit's also worth noting that the photos used for my reviews are my own work.  I quite enjoy mixing two of my favorite pastimes :D\",\n",

       " 'Hello everyone, I’ve lurked here a bit, waiting for payday and the chance to splash out on a good bottle of whiskey now that I am no longer a student. I’ve always enjoyed a decent whiskey but only in the past year or so have I taken note of what I’ve been given by some of my more experienced friends. I fully intended to buy a bottle of Ardbeg 10 but was in my local Waitrose picking up some fruit or veg and saw this on sale for £27.00 (about 44 dollars) and just couldn’t say no to the description on the bottle and that I knew Aberlour was pretty good. I have no experience doing this and my area of expertise is much more in the tasting of ales but I know what I like!\\n\\nAberlour A’bunadh (Batch 42)\\n\\nColour: Amber, pretty much the colour of a good ginger wine. \\n\\nNose: I really struggled with this, I’ve just started a new job and it’s in a lab and my nose isn’t on it’s greatest form right now. But I got a bit of Marzipan, noticed the sherry lightly and sort of long forgotten dried winter fruits. Honestly it just smells like winter to me. It is wonderful. For a 60 odd percent alcohol there’s really no hint of solvents.\\n\\nPalate: Not as sweet as I thought it might be but still sweet (worried it might be a bit sickly), a hint of spice on the end of the tongue, there’s something soft at the back end that I can’t place but is very nice.\\n\\nFinish: The spice settles onto the end of the tongue as a concentrated winter warmth, the faintest whiff of vanilla.\\n\\nI haven’t got any good water in and generally don’t like my whiskey anything other than neat so despite the strength I’m going to forgo watering it down for now. Honestly I’m so glad I picked this up, it is completely the opposite end to the whiskey I normally drink, I normally go for something with a massive smoky punch like the Ardbeg but this is, well. It is smoother and far more subtle despite the alcoholic strength. It is a beautiful winter drink, honestly I can’t imagine a better whiskey to receive for Christmas so if you want to treat someone (or treat yourself) then this is really that sort of wintery thing that would be perfect. I had one sip that felt like the alcohol overpowered a bit but I was probably trying to hard to find flavours and it seems to create a funky little kick behind my left eye but it’s enjoyable in a pretty weird way.\\n\\nOverall: 89/100 I can’t imagine finding anything better for this price. Certainly on a par with Ardbeg 10 if very different. Ardbeg is for when you are in a Scottish bar in the back end of nowhere and you’ve been hiking all day. This is for when you’ve had a day at work where it has been raining all day and you have a dog on your lap and winter is coming.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Softened with water to reveal orange peel, overripe bananas, and cider vinegar.\\n* **palate:** Syrupy. Sweet up front. Toffee. Burnt sugar.\\n* **finish:** Packs a whallop. Strong sherry notes. Bran muffins. Water brings out cherry cola.\\n\\nScore: **83/100**\\n\\n(I realize this is the upcoming community review but I'm doing it now for the sake of completeness.)

Chocolate and coffee notes on the back end.\\n\\nScore: **85/100**\\n\\nI've had this before but never reviewed it. I think I prefer it over the a'Bunadh. Everything should be cask strength.\\n_________________\\n**Day 6 - Compass Box Asyla**\\n\\nBlend (includes grain whisky). 40% ABV.\\n\\n* **color:** Almost colorless. Like water with a twist of lemon.\\n* **nose:**  Light. Citrusy. So far it looks and smells like a white wine. Develops some sweetness over time.\\n* **palate:** Thin. Some oak. Smooth, but not much flavor. It did become more complex after a while, but not much.\\n* **finish:** Pretty short. Grassy. I thought I detected some smoke now and again.\\n\\nScore: **68/100**\\n\\nI'm still struggling to appreciate grain whisky. I'd like to know just how much was in this. I scored this lower than the Hedonism, which has a lot more flavor. Honestly this was like a watered-down malt. \\n__________________\\n**Day 7 - Nikka Taketsuru 21**\\n\\nJapan. Blended malt. 43% ABV.\\n\\n* **color:** Bright gold.\\n* **nose:**  Mellow and earthy. Reminds me of a harvest. Cereal notes. Buttered toast. \\n* **palate:** Chocolate. Pleasantly bitter. Not as smooth as I expected for the age.\\n* **finish:** Long-lasting. It coats the mouth in a distinctly Japanese way - I don't know how else to describe the sensation.\\n\\nScore: **88/100**\\n\\nI really enjoy Japanese whiskies. They're unique and yet somehow familiar. This was very good, although I didn't score it quite as high as jaf1211.\",\n",
       " '**Fourth Review: Aberlour A’Bunadh Batch 42**\\n\\nAlright, I have had this bottle for a few month now but have just finally cracked it to share a bit with my Pops over Turkey day.  I’ve been away from scotch and back in bourbon land for a bit as it is simply that time of the year.  Now though, I am prepping for a tasting I plan to have with my friends in a couple of months and want to sample and review all the drams ahead of time so I can be more of a host and focus a bit less on the scotch.  I have been very excited to try this one. \\nNeat, in a Glencairn, as the first real snowfall of the year begins.\\n\\n*Aberlour A’Bunadh batch 42, $55ish.*  Cask Strength at 60.3% abv, non-chill filtered.\\n\\n* **Color:**  Amber +2.  Super sherry color.  I could find no indication that this is naturally colored, but I don’t know.\\n\\n* **Nose:**  SHERRY!  Ultra sweetness and not much else up front.  Certainly some alcohol, but I expected more at this ABV, yet the sherry dominates.  There is also a note I really do not like that seems a bit like plastic.  Burnt glue.  Reminds me a bit of summers spent working at 3M.  Blood orange, dark citrus type notes, but of a slightly artificial nature.  Fruit cake and chocolate covered nuts (or chocolate and nuts…).     \\n  \\n* **Taste:**  Hiyo!  There’s the alcohol.  Not bad though.  More chocolate is what I get first.  Darkish chocolate that is.  Spices left and right, cloves and black pepper, and a nice oakyness.  It really is a nice toasted oak character that I do not even get in a lot of bourbons.  Yeah sherry, chocolate, and oak with some spice.  Liking this more than the nose, and it tastes less artificial then it smells, but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  I don’t know that I have ever had figs…but this seems Figgy.  I would like to have this with some Figgy pudding from the Christmas songs.\\n\\n* **Finish:**  So sweet and warming.  Ultra pleasant.  Strawberries and old pipe tobacco from an old wood box.  \\n\\nI was hoping to enjoy the nose more than I did, and overall it was a bit too sweet to me.  I get that is probably the point, but I don’t know.  It’s still pretty darn good, I just think I overhyped myself or something.  This seems like a very situational type dram, Christmas Eve and I don’t know what else.  I know the batches vary, and I hope to try others.  I was planning to save a dram of this to compare to future batches, but I really don’t see myself buying another bottle too quickly as I still have much to explore in the world of scotch.\\n\\n**82/100.**\\n',\n",

The alcohol is a little shielding and as it settles the nose becomes really satisfying.\\n\\n* **Palate:** Yes yes this needs water, entrance is hot and intense with ginger orange and spicy sherry, but remains creamy somehow with inviting cherries and prunes.  The barrel bitter notes are not quite tannic, but similar to a persistent wine in the way the alcohol rolls over the tongue.  Kinda makes you shiver then smack your lips in sweetness.  It needs to settle in the glass, especially if you add a substantial amount of water like I did.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Hot, the box says “exotic spices” and that’s pretty accurate; a lot going on. The sweetness continues almost like grenadine and becomes more dried fruit and the spices mellow to become an afterthought.  My first two sips were without water and I still feel it in the back of my throat.\\n\\n> **85/100** It’s a big spicy Oloroso sherry bomb with a wonderful nose.  I like my sherry to be more sweet dried fruit like figs raisins as opposed to a spicy nutty oxidized pang.  It’s a little rambunctious and a bit too hot for me.

       " 'Aberlour A’bunadh (“the Original”) has, until recently, been a darling of Scotchit-- a massive sherry bomb and prime example of NAS done tastefully, with lots of reviews and fairly high accolades. There seems to be a general consensus, though, that the spirit has declined in quality over time. Adding insult to that perceived injury was Pernod Ricard’s decision to hike the price significantly in mid-2018-- while it cost around $80 locally for me only a year ago, a bottle of A’bunadh now costs close to $110. \\n\\nOne of the debates that I see threaded through the general quality dip is how much batch variation actually exists in the A’bunadh line-- how much of this comes down to ‘golden’ or ‘dud’ batches, and whether exposure to air or time opened makes a difference. There are lots of comparison reviews of A’bunadh for this reason, with reviewers seeking out subtle (or not-so-subtle) differences. Others claim that there is no really significant change between batches. \\n\\nAfter trying Aberlour 12 NCF earlier this year and enjoying it, I decided to leap to A’bunadh and went looking for different batches locally. Most of what I saw was between batches 60 and 62, but being interested in harder-to-get bottles I looked for and eventually found a slightly older one-- batch 53, from 2015. A little while later I found another bottle at a different store, batch 44 from 2012. Batches of A’bunadh vary slightly in ABV, but both of these were the exact same at 59.7%. To satiate some of my curiosity, I decided to pick up the 44 and open them both at the same time, keeping their fill levels relatively similar over time. As always, I try to reflect in this review my experience with the whisky over time and how things change.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Aberlour A’bunadh, Batch 44\\n\\nbottled 2012\\n\\n###Aberlour A’bunadh, Batch 53\\n\\nbottled 2015\\n\\nBoth 750mL bottles, 59.7% ABV, NCF ~ $83 USD each.\\n\\nTime scale: uncapped at the same time and open around five months, tasting notes taken:\\n\\n* **just beneath the shoulder,**\\n\\n* and beneath the ½ mark.\\n\\n*(no significant changes at the heel)*\\n\\n|Batch 44|Batch 53|\\n|-|-|\\n|Nose: **loads of oak, sweetened dark chocolate, a faint hint of burnt matches, very dark fruits (stewed blackberries), with time in the glass fruits begin to come forward,** vanilla custard, dark cherries in the background. |Nose: **stewed red fruits, dark cherries, blackberry jam, nutmeg, cherry cordials, cinnamon gum, milk chocolate.**|\\n|Palate: **dark cherries, more tannic oak.**|Palate: **BIG sherry spices, earth and dead leaves (like a forest floor), herbal spice in the background.**|\\n|Finish: **long ~ sherry spices, even more tannic oak/wood spice, very drying, bitter dark chocolate, a faint hint of acetone,** acetone comes a bit more forward as time passes. |Finish: **medium-long ~ lots of wood spice mingling with more cinnamon, menthol, nutmeg,** a wave of cherry cordial.|\\n|Bottle thoughts: Wooden core throughout at first, with some fruit and chocolate coming forward later on with time to open up. Decent, but this remains super oaky, not at all what I expect in a sherry bomb. The nose promises more than the palate delivers, and the acetone on the finish is definitely not great. Fairly consistent across the life of the bottle with few changes-- something more coming out of the oakiness might have been a welcome change. |Bottle thoughts: Now this is more like it-- sherry driven through and through. One of the things I love about this is the way the cinnamon-cherry-herbal wave spreads like wildfire across the tongue. This has none of the wood-driven character of #44; the wood is still in there, but it’s taking a back seat and letting other interesting things come forward. Relatively simple but powerful profile. Extraordinarily consistent across the life of the bottle, and when the flavors pack a punch like this, that’s a very good thing.|\\n|Score: **6½** |Score: **8+** |\\n\\n*****\\n\\nOn takeaway, huge difference between these two batches despite identical ABV and identical air exposure. Granted, my methods aren’t bulletproof by any means-- it’s a tiny sampling, doesn’t look at older or more recent bottlings, and there are a bunch of things that can’t be factored in like handling of the bottles before purchase, etc., but I thought I’d try to give a different take on this debate. It surprised me that I liked a batch in the 50s so much more than a batch in the 40s, and that the latter had many of the woody/chocolaty qualities I have seen others describe as detrimental to the more recent batches. \\n\\nBased on this experience I feel that A’bunadh has considerable variation between batches, not just due to exposure or ABV differences. That said, the general profile is simple and sherry-driven enough that sampling it from time to time like a sane person (rather than comparing full bottles head-to-head like this) most likely presents a similar experience across batches. I may have scored these radically differently, but that’s over five months of sampling and side-by-side comparison-- I think I would be unlikely to notice those differences or highlight them the same way if these were one-time bar pours. For reference, I have also had batches 58 and 60 in bars, and although admittedly hard to compare directly to a bottle at home, I don’t remember any significant qualitative differences in the experience of either one.\\n\\nI wouldn’t pay $110 to have either of these again, but I did buy another bottle of the old 12 NCF at $63. That absolutely satiates my Aberlour desires for now.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAbout my scoring: I’ve settled into a 10-point scale by half-points, with a little room for fudging (+/-) I’ll keep tweaking it as I go. \\n\\n**10** ~ Outstanding, transcendent\\n\\n**9** ~ Excellent, complex, balanced and flavorful ^*Laphroaig* ^*10* ^*CS*\\n\\n**8** ~ Great, eminently enjoyable ^*Oban* ^*18*\\n\\n**7** ~ Good and solid ^*Aultmore* ^*12*\\n\\n**6** ~ Decent, above average ^*Monkey* ^*Shoulder*\\n\\n**5** ~ Average, uninspiring, drinkable ^*Compass* ^*Box* ^*G.K.S.* ^*Glasgow*\\n\\n**4** ~ Below average, not connecting ^*Tobermory* ^*10*\\n\\n**3** ~ Subpar, unpleasant ^*Johnnie* ^*Walker* ^*Ultimate* ^*18*\\n\\n**2** ~ Distasteful\\n\\n**1** ~ Impressively nasty',\n",
       " \"Hello /r/scotch community. I feel like I'm constantly reviewing some of the most popular scotches here, but I suppose that speaks to the quality of these bottles. Today, I'm taking a look at the popular and well regarded Aberlour A'bundah. \\n\\n**Color:** damn amazing. Seriously, this is a deep Carmel that shows off beautifully. Almost reddish hue here in the bottle. \\n___\\n**Nose:** oaky richness, raisin, fresh cut apples, burnt brown sugar\\n___\\n**Taste:** simply put, incredible. There's a deep raisin flavor here that sucks me in like no other scotch. It's that flavor you get when you bite into the raisin and it releases that intensely sweet, fragrant flavor. Strong sherry notes here, but also a cooling mint flavor starts to develop on the tongue the longer you let it sit (water tends to bring out the mint even more, I've noticed)\\n___\\n**Finish:** long and intense. It's not until the finish that you really begin to realize that this single malt is an intense 120 proof. On the nose and tongue, the alcohol doesn't overpower like you might expect it to. But on the finish, it'll surprise you. It's not harsh, it's just a long intense finish that warms your body and releases more of that soft minty flavor to contrast the sweet sherry notes. I love it. \\n___\\n**The verdict: 94/100**\\n___\\n**Summary:** this is, hands down, my favorite bottle to date. Classic Speyside flavors turned up to eleven.  Some have said batch 44 is hit or miss, but I must say that this bottle is a massive hit.  If you haven't experienced cask strength scotch, this Aberlour will show you immediately what all the talk is about. Highly, highly recommended. \",\n",
       " 'Hello, everyone, this is my first review here, so bear with me.  I just picked up this bottle, and am very excited to open it, so I decided to share it with you all.  I know this batch has caught some crap, but we\\'ll see how it goes.  Here are the notes that Aberlour gives this dram:\\n\\n**Nose**:  Aromas of mixed spices, praline, and spiced orange harmonizing with rich, deep notes of Oloroso sherry\\n**Palate**: Orange, black cherries, dried fruit, and ginger, spiked with dark bitter chocolate and enriched with sherry and oak.  Full bodied and creamy.\\n**Finish**: Robust and intense with bitter-sweet notes of exotic spices, dark chocolate and oak.\\n\\nAberlour recommends drinking this 59.7% deep amber beauty with \"a dash of water\" however, I have opted to drink it straight.  For those interested, I\\'m using a glencairn.  So, without further ado, here are my notes.\\n\\n**Nose**:  First hit is strong sherry and certainly some fruit notes.  Not picking up on spices right off the bat, but some tartness or sourness lingering somewhere in the background?  On a second sniff, still sherry, but the sourness or tartness has transformed into more of a citrusy praline concoction.  Sherry notes are very deep, and for lack of better words, seems to swirl and brood on the nose.  Third sniff, the spice is now lingering as an accent note, but certainly there on later nosings, and the citrus has become more orangy, and is accompanied by black cherry.\\n\\n**Palate**:  Black cherry, and sherry.  Coats the tongue very smoothly, and chewy.  Orange is there with semi-sweet chocolate  (For those who are familiar with Lindt, imagine their orange filled bar but with their 70% chocolate instead of milk).  It is just smokey enough to add mystery.\\n\\n**Finish**:  Spice.  Not in the common, \"this has heat way\" but in a rich, flavorful way.  A warm, long finish, most likely from the alcohol content, combined with a oaky smokiness that takes its time leaving my mouth.  If I didn\\'t have my eyes open, I would have sworn I could tell that a cloud of amber steam came out of my mouth on the exhale.\\n\\n**General thoughts**:  I like this scotch.  It\\'s not perfect, but then what is.  For me, this is almost nostalgic.  Growing up, my grandparents had a house on an island in Maine, where they had a friend who was a lobsterman, Bobby.  Bobby smoked a pipe, specifically with black cherry tobacco.  As soon as I picked up on the cherry notes, I felt like I was a kid again, playing cribbage with my family, Bobby, and his wife, with a wood fire on the stove.  I\\'ve never had a flashback when drinking scotch, so this is a first.  Perhaps that\\'s why I picked up on so many smoke notes, why I enjoy it so much. I\\'d recommend it for a late summer\\'s night, maybe in September, when the evenings are starting to get cool and you need something to warm you up.  Overall, very good, and glad I picked up the bottle.\\n\\nOverall rating: 90/100\\n\\nHope you all enjoyed this review!',\n",

After sitting for a few minutes, the symphony of notes really begin to emerge. Oak, orange rind, vanilla, nutmeg, rye spice, raisins, even the candi sugar of a Belgian dubbel all take part in a sweet, heavy, and complex aroma.

       " '**Review**: Aberlour A\\'bunadh Batch #45 (Review #12)\\n\\n**Price**: $74.99 Julio\\'s \\n**ABV**: 60.2%\\n\\n**Scene**: This is the whisky I went questing for.  I have had a drip of it once before.  I ordered it in a bar and the bartender came back with a nearly empty bottle.  He drained the bottle and there was about half a shot, so he didn\\'t charge me.  There was only enough to get the aroma and a couple tiny sips but it was enough to know I wanted a bottle. \\n\\nI know I prefer the sherry bombs, and this could be \"the one\".  Let\\'s see!\\n\\n**Appearance**: Golden-orange, expected very thin, slow running legs - they seemed whisky normal in width and pace.\\n\\n**Nose (30/30)**: Caramel and anise, milkshake, orange extract, sherried oak, vanilla, Cinnamon roll, cloves.  I let this sit for about 2 hours before nosing.  It gives my nose a chance against the cask strength alcohol.  I appoached the glass slowly and I have to say this is as close to perfect as I can imagine!  Full inhale from inside the glass still too strong to really enjoy.\\n\\n**Taste (45/50)**: Liquid honey poured over a dry biscuit, warm spiced tea followed by orange rind, toffee and hazelnuts with a bitter aftertaste, caramel, malt, cinnamon red hots, spicy warm goodness peaking to a bitter spike and then backing off to warmth.\\n\\n**Finish (18/20)**: The lingering warmth stays in your mouth, but a small sip can disappear with little finish.  A larger mouthful leaves your palate dancing with heat as you get a tingling, not quite numbing cinnamon tingle all the way down your throat.\\n\\n**Overall (93/100)**: Small sips avoided the only off taste which was the \"bitter middle\" a larger draw could cause.  Great sweet and spicy nose, sherry bomb flavors and a tamed firey finish. \\n\\n**BOTTOM LINE**: Pretty damn good!  I\\'d say it is my favorite at this point.  Hate to add water to any dram, but this may be one to experiment with a few drops just to see how it is impacted.  Neat you really need to nurse this with small sips for the tastiest experience, but that takes away from the bite on the finish.  Need to make some fine adjustments, but really enjoyed this dram!',\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh  Batch #45**  \\n\\n* Color: Reddish Gold\\n* Nose:  Powerful Sherry, almost overwhelming pungent, albeit in a good way.  I get some citrus and some mint as well.\\n* Palate:  Creamy, complex, and a ton of sherry.  Well balanced as far as that it's not overly sweet. I get a hint of cherries? as well as definite spices and I think toffee.  The high ABV can make it a little difficult to differentiate everything (at least for me).  Definitely one to drink by itself as it will overpower any food you wish to consume.\\n* Finish: Luxurious, long and warming from the inside out.  I get a big spiciness that mellows out into a long lasting oak taste in the mouth.  It's amazing to me how powerful the finish can be even after a few minutes.  \\n\\n* Price: $67 (California) \\n* Rating: 96/100 \\n* 60.2 % ABV  \\n\\n**Macallan Sherry Cask Strength**  \\n\\n* Color: Dark Red\\n* Nose:  Sherry, Floral notes, and hints of chocolate.\\n* Palate:  Rich, Sweet, Sherried, and Spicy.

Compared to the A'Bunadh, which is only .1% more, it's like night and day; where with the Aberlour you definitely notice the high ABV, the Macallan just sails right through.\\n* Finish: Long and warming.  Not too complex, but that doesn't take too much away from it as it's an enjoyable finish.  Peppery and slightly dry at the end.\\n\\n* Price: $75 (California) - Found a few bottles at a shop I don't frequent as it's discontinued\\n* Rating: 94/100 \\n* 60.1 % ABV  \\n\\nBoth of these are excellent whiskies, and it was truly a treat to be able to compare them next to each other.  While the Macallan is as smooth as they come, which says a lot considering it's cask strength, I have to rate the A'bunadh higher.  They're neck and neck on the nose, but the Aberlour pulls ahead on the palate; it feels more complex and the flavors just strike a chord with me.  Both finishes are nice, but again the A'bunadh gains an extra point here for being a tad more complex.  That's really all that separates the two.  Both are amazing bottles, and if you have a chance to snag a Macallan CS prior to them all disappearing, I would highly recommend it.\",\n",

Raisins, dried figs, Mexican chocolate again, developing some spice as it goes - the black pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice are all there. Very bold, rich flavor. Medium-plus body, not quuuuite as heavy or syrupy as I anticipated though.\\n\\n**Finish** - Spice notes really take off here - the pepper especially, but the previously mentioned baking spices are all here, with an underlying dark fruity/chocolatey sweetness.\\n\\nSo this one is bold, full flavored, quite tasty, but a little simple. One nice thing about those age stated Glendronachs (as one example) is that the extra time in oak has provided some nice oaky/earthy notes to balance out the bold, youthful fruity and spicy notes something like this has, which really adds to the experience. This is still very good in its own right, though, but it’d be fun if they put out something like Glendronach does in the 15-20 year range.\\n\\n**89**/100\\n',\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh, Batch 45**\\n\\n60.2% ABV, US $65.00, Speyside\\n\\n**Color:** Amber\\n\\n**Nose:** Spice, sherry, heavy alcohol, orange, banana, toast, cream, nuts, oak, carmel, other fruit. The alcohol really hits you up front and took me aback at first but the flavors came out soon after. Sherry clearly sticks out, followed by the fruit and general sweetness.\\n\\n**Palate:** Spice, sherry, plum, almond, allspice, cherry, raspberry, earthy, vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon. The longer it sits and the more I taste the more flavors come through. Definitely very complex and strong all around. The sweetness really sets in at the end which is a welcome surprise after the initial burn.\\n\\n**Finish:** Sherry, cinnamon, smoke, earthy, spice, vanilla, orange, creamy. Light finish, doesn't linger too long though the sherry sticks around a bit. Creamy and a cinnamon-esque feel near the end.\\n\\n**90/100**. This is by far the strongest whisky I've tried so far in terms of both pure alcohol, sherry and flavor. I normally don't add water but I've been adding a few drops to this. I had some with a porterhouse earlier tonight and the smoky grilled flavors matched excellently, so that was nice. All in all this is very complex and continues to grow on me. This was hyped up pretty highly to me and I'm not so sure it matched my raised expectations, but I enjoyed it.\",\n",

       " 'These reviews were done blind, but I have had both bottles before and I was able to tell which was which based on the tasting.\\n\\n**#1: Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 45 (60.2% abv) ($80)**\\n\\nColor: amber\\n\\nNose: strong sherry, vanilla, dried fruit, oak, chocolate\\n\\nTaste: sherry, dried fruit, chocolate, honey, raisins\\n\\nFinish: cherry, chocolate, oak, vanilla\\n\\nOverall: 92/100\\n\\nThe color of this one was amber, almost orange. The nose is great with an overpowering sherry smell giving way to strong vanilla notes. There is dried fruit, oak, and chocolate-covered behind everything. In the mouth, this one is excellent with a strong sherry flavor leading the way again. Personally, I am big sherry fan so the more sherry flavor the better. Behind the sherry is some more dried fruits, especially raisins. The chocolate on the nose delivers like a rich Belgian dark chocolate filled with sherry cream filling. There is also some honey adding to the sweetness. The finish is good, but could be better for a cask strength offering. The finish is chocolate-covered cherries again, with oak and vanilla in the background. There is also something there that I can’t exactly place my finger, almost like dry wood. This is great dram that I do not get tired of. I am almost positive this is A’bunadh because I have had this bottle before. I would be shocked if this were the Glenfarclas. It looks like I guessed right.\\n\\n\\n**#2 : Glenfarclas 105 (60% abv) ($80)**\\n\\nColor: golden orange\\n\\nNose: sherry, fruity, vanilla, raisins, cereal\\n\\nTaste: plums, raisins, sherry, chocolate, pears\\n\\nFinish: long, rich, cherry, chocolate, sherry, raisins\\n\\nOverall: 90/100\\n\\nThe color of this one is lighter than the other one, it is more orange than amber. The nose on this one is a little disappointing compare to the last one. The sherry notes aren’t nearly as strong, but that makes the background notes easier to detect. The rest of the nose is very fruity with sweet raisins. There is also vanilla present, but not as much as the last. In the mouth, my first impression is that it is a lot oilier than the last one. This one is not as intense as the last one with lighter fruit flavors being equally balanced with the sherry. There is also a chocolate that the rich mouthfeel compliments. The finish is where this one really shines. This finish is much better than the last one. It is long and rich and just does not die down. There are chocolate covered cherries, like with the last one except it does not die and gets more rich and creamy. I think the last one was better on the nose and in the mouth, but this one is a much better finish. Overall, I like the other one a little better due to the other elements, but I would buy a bottle of either when I have a chance. I think this is Glenfarclas, and it looks like it is.\\n',\n",

Price: £35  \\n* Colour: A nice dark copper, apparently no colouring is used (correct me if I'm wrong) which is impressive.  \\n* Nose: Lots of sherry, Christmas pudding, sweet, little bit of freshly sawn oak which becomes more prominent if you leave the glass a bit after finishing, various dark fruit. A friend compared it to Christmas in a glass.  \\n* Palate: Starts out sweet with a big sherry flavour (it is known as a sherry bomb after all!) then it begins to develop a slightly bitter almost metallic flavour, although this is less prominent than when I first opened the bottle so it may actually lose the metallic flavour. Some dark chocolate also appears as well as the dark fruit from the nose. Also there is a strong spiciness that comes through the longer it stays in your mouth. Surprisingly little alcohol burn for such a strong whisky.  \\n* Finish: The finish is long and warming with the spiciness lingering. The spiciness slowly fades and gives way to a Christmas pudding flavour and some more sherry but also a nice mild bittersweet tingle with none of the aforementioned metallic flavour.  \\nScore: 89 but would move to 91 if the metallic flavour disappears. A very enjoyable whisky and different to things I have tried before, would definitely like to try the apparently similar Macallan cask strength before it's gone for good.  \\nEdit: if someone can give me the idiot's guide to bullet points in the formatting I would be very appreciative.\",\n",

       " \"For a few years now, I would have called myself a “Rum drinker”, but that probably wasn’t totally accurate. I liked a few decent rums, and I could stand them neat. Recently I started trying other types of alcohol, and absolutely fell in love with Scotch. In my explorations I eventually stumbled across sherry Scotch (not all that hard to do really). Needless to say from the review pool, I am now a huge fan of Sherry Cask Scotches. I have a large “to get” list, and many of my purchases (and my future reviews) moving forward are going to involve broadening my selection and trying styles I have only had once or never at all. I feel I have reached a point now where my reviews may actually mean something, so here we go!\\n\\n\\n**Tasting Method:** .5 oz at a time, and 2.5oz total for each review. I revisited it across 5 nights to get the best perspective that wasn't tainted from one day.\\n\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**Dalwhinnie 15 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Highland, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Green apples at the forefront with charcoal on the edge of the smell. Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.\\n\\n**Taste:** This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice. \\n\\n**Finish:** Both sour and sweet elements carry over, hanging onto a bit of the charcoal note as well. The floral notes in the nose come back here at the end of the taste, but I can’t put my finger on any particular flower names….it is just floral. A decent yet light mouth feel. The flavor lingers for 1-2 minutes.\\n\\n**Rating:** 84/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I’ve had my ups and downs with this Scotch. Overall it’s a pretty low key and is trying to be as inoffensive as possible. It’s very simple, its major elements are sweet, and it doesn’t really leave a characteristically defining impact on me. This is what I imagine an “okay” lowland would taste like, which is one style I have yet to actually try. Out of everything I currently have, this is where I would start someone new to Scotch tasting.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 10 Year Fine Oak**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 40%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Overall a light nose, with white grapes and green apples being the primary elements. Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived. \\n\\n**Finish:** Aftertaste is rich but un-abrasive, with vanilla, mild spiced cinnamon (certainly of sherry origin) and a background of oak. It is a pronounced aftertaste, but lingers for only about 1-2 minutes. Very little mouth feel, but there is some. \\n\\n**Rating:** 88/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is nice, if a bit simple. I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background. \\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 12 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Grapes and apples to about equal degrees, with maybe a touch of cherry. A spiciness that wraps itself nicely into the initial fruit aroma, with a lingering oak background. It’s nice, not too overwhelming but certainly appetizing. \\n\\n**Taste:** Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. \\n\\n**Finish:** The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes. This has a good mouth feel that isn’t too intense, but is intense enough to make itself known on the tongue. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a good 2-3 minutes, certainly satisfying. \\n\\n**Rating:** 91/100\\n\\n**Summary:** I really like this Scotch, it’s not trying to be the most complex or intricate masterpiece but it is amazingly solid at what it is trying to do and embraces what it brings to the table. It is refined enough to sit and analyze, but casual enough to be a daily drinker. Out of all my Sherry Scotches, if I HAD to pick one to keep around as an “affordable” drinker it would be this (let’s hope it never comes to that)!\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan 18 Year**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 43%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet fruits galore, a bit hard to peg down but cherry, apples, grapes and some berry I can’t put my finger on. The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. \\n\\n**Taste:** Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.\\n\\n**Finish:** The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste. The mouth feel is much more prevalent and hot on the tongue, and without a decent enough amount of time could very quickly numb it. The flavor lingers for easily 3-4 minutes plus.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** This is really spectacular and exactly what I was expecting out of a “high end” Scotch. Complexity that leaves me entirely fulfilled while keeping every element of said complexity in the aftertaste to be enjoyed for as long as possible. This stuff is pretty expensive and is not something I would ever drink daily, but boy do I wish I could.\\n\\n**----------------------**\\n\\n**The Macallan Cask Strength**\\n\\n**Alcohol Content:** 58.4%\\n\\n**Region:** Speyside, Scotland\\n\\n**Nose:** A very vibrant and rich aroma with elements of caramel, spice, hot cinnamon, sweet grapes, red apples, and cherry. Very powerful, and a few good whiffs leave a mild sting/numbness in the nose which is really great.\\n\\n**Taste:** A bit of toffee right before a hot cinnamon and spice blast, intense but not overboard. It doesn’t take long for the most intense part to pass, where afterwards come in caramel, a myriad of different apples but mainly red, sweet grapes, a bit of cherry, a tinge of bitter on the tongue. All the flavors are very deep, and I wouldn’t say one of them takes the “background” roll. All very upfront and in your face.\\n\\n**Finish:** Hot spice lingers on the tongue, with a nice oak note coming through now. Along with it are cinnamon and apples ringing on the tongue, a very vibrant and deep mouth feel. The taste lingers for 3-4 minutes plus. A bit of numbing of the tongue which I love.\\n\\n**Rating:** 95/100\\n\\n**Summary:** Wow, this is superb! I don’t think it’s as evolving in taste as the 18, but all of its flavors are much more powerful and rich. I really enjoy Macallan for their focus on hot spice notes, and boy does this have it in force. I hunted down the last two bottles I could find locally, and I’m glad I did. I can only hope it comes back into production sometime. This along with the A’bunadh make me wish more distilleries would consistently release cask strength batches. \",\n",
       " 'Stock photo... Left my bottle at a friends house.\\nTook me a while to put this up as I’ve been busy and couldn’t pick a number. Figured it was good one for number 20!  I wouldn’t rate the taste this high, but I’d put the finnish close to 100 (although my experience is limited).\\n\\n* **Colour:** Varnished oak.\\n* **Nose:** Oak, sherry, caramel, almonds, figs, wine, bitter ash.\\n* **Without water:** I get one strong kick in the face. Full bodied, dry with the sherry sweetness. Good, but I was wondering what all the fuss has been when I saw other peoples reviews.\\n* **With water:** Opens up to something more amazing.. Spends time working on you, even when you think the flavour has gone there’s still something at work that you keep noticing. \\n* **Taste:** Sweet but not too sweet, toffee, sherry, creamy butterscotch, fresh green leafy herbs with a touch of bitterness, mince pies, summer fruits, figs, toast. \\n* **Finish:** Long and astonishing, I’ve never had a bottle with a finish like this. Warming caramel and sherry notes blend into creamy, peppery oak which lasts minutes ending on a spicy tingle in your mouth with a bit of lime rind. When I breath there’s almost a umami meatiness and when everything finally fades away my mouth is left watering.\\n* **Score:** 92/100\\n\\nThe taste is great, but the finish really makes this.. Something I haven’t experienced before. Definitely one of my favourites so far.',\n",

Unfortunately, the Batch 36 A'Bunadh is now empty and won't be in the VS section where I sampled them all against each other :( \\n\\nFirst up-- The set of 4 A'Bunadh\\n\\n**Batch 36 - 60.1% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: caramel, strawberry, maraschino cherry, nutmeg?, cinnamon?, chocolate, something I can't quite put my finger on -> maybe fresh pine?\\n\\nAll kinds of delicious coming through here! The sweet, balanced by the spices - fantastic in my books!\\n\\n**Palate**: Strawberry, sweet, very oily and thick feeling. It took me a while to figure what it was that I was missing, but I think it's a sour maraschino cherry note that is coming through in a fantastic way.\\n\\n**Finish**: more strawberry again, spices of cinnamon, and a sweetness that comes through to me as icing sugar, that drying sweetness. \\n\\nAs an overall, I wish I had some more of this left in that open bottle. When it was still available, I did get myself a 2nd so that I can revisit it in the years to come.\\nI ranked this one in at **93**/100\\n\\n**Batch 39 - 59.8% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: candied fruit, lemon grass, salt, cloyingly sweet caramel, oranges, chocolate\\n\\nNo hint of the ABV on the nose, but all kinds of delicious just waiting to be found here in my glass\\n\\n**Palate**: WOW there's the alcohol, unfortunately too overwhelming to really pick out the elements from the nose, I had to press it\\n\\n**Finish**: spices and cranberry\\n\\nExcellent finish, but on the palate, way too much alcohol to pick anything out when it is taken neat.  \\n\\n**Pressed notes**: ~10drops\\n\\nNose: more caramel, more salt, orange\\n\\nPalate: oranges, caramel, spices\\n\\nFinish: spices, caramel, chocolate dryness\\n\\nThis one, **92**/100\\n\\n**Batch 40 - 60.0% ABV**\\n\\n**Nose**: Sweet!, leather, light spices of a variety I can't place, toffee, Werther's originals, slight hint of high ABV\\n\\n**Palate**: CS!, spicy, oily, chocolate and prunes\\n\\n**Finish**: chocolate, spices -> like a hot apple cider\\n\\nNot as rich a finish or palate as the other 2 above, but still quite good, **88**/100.\\n\\n**Batch 46 - 60.4%**\\n\\n**Nose**: very young - lots of alcohol prevalent here, toffee apple, lemon zest, coca, strawberry, light cinnamon\\n\\n**Palate**: difficult to get passed the alcohol, peppery, ginger, buttery, bing cherry, some cherry as well\\n\\n**Finish**: pepper, drying, strawberries\\n\\nThis one was much noticeably younger than the previous mentions here. So even though it's similar ABV, it was much more apparent than the others, even with a press it was more difficult to pick apart the pieces. Unfortunately, this is definitely the younger brother not measuring up to the others. **80**/100 here.\\n\\n**Macallan CS 1st release - 60.1%**\\n\\nI sampled this one with the Glencairn and the Canadian Glencairn, so a few nosing notes from each of them. For a bit of a change, I put the nosing notes of the Canadian in *italics* along with the Glencairn in regular, just to make things a bit neater. Where I go the same notes, I've indicated with an +.\\n\\n**Nose**: Cherry+, caramel+, some alcohol *slightly more intense with the Canadian*, after a while this turned floral+, *dates*, *nail polish remover*\\n\\nThe cherry note is very strong in this one! With the 2 glasses having about 1oz each, the whole of the room was filled with the smell. Also smelled of apple blossoms after a spring rain throughout the room. Super rich on the nose, very, very intense!\\n\\n**Palate**: feels tingly on the tongue, oily and rich, there's a sweetness to this one to go with the cherries, which are the predominant note here, kind of like an alcoholic cherry danish\\n\\n**Finish**: Cherry, MacIntosh toffee, lasts forever and ever (still had some finish the next morning and yes I brushed my teeth and used mouth wash....), on the breath is like canned cherry juice - delicious!\\n\\nThis was much sharper than some of the A'Bunadhs and in some ways not quite as complex, but with the nose filling the room as it did this is an amazing dram! **94**/100\\n\\n**Bowmore Devil's Cask - 56.9%**\\n\\nThis one is a re-review from quite some time ago when I first started reviewing here. This time around I've used a Canadian Glencairn for the review. I've brought the previous notes along in italics for comparison sake.\\n\\n**Nose**: Musty, caramel, leather, fruity, some alcohol present\\n\\n*unknown fruit, pine? leather, light spice, caramel, some alcohol*\\n\\n**Palate**: Leather, dark fruits, caramel, sweet and musty\\n\\n*smoke, ABV comes through, thick and oily after a bit of time swirling in the mouth, caramel, fruitcake, dark chocolate (90%), tingly on the tongue*\\n\\n**Finish**: musty, fruity, with a long lingering fruit juice note\\n\\n*spices, dried dark fruit, sweet, medium-long*\\n\\nI had previously scored this at a 90, although I think my liking for it has increased. The overall fit and finish for this scotch is fantastic! I would say just as delicious as the A'Bunadh 39.\",\n",

       " \"Greetings Scotchit! Today I've been home alone all day as my girlfriend is at a bachelorette party, and I decided that this would be the perfect occasion to perform the experiment I've been thinking about doing for a while. Specifically, it's a semi-blind tasting of the big three cask strength sherry bombs: Aberlour A'bunadh (Batch 46), Glenfarclas 105 and GlenDronach CS (Batch 3). Macallan CS would have been a good addition, but they decided to take their ball and go home.\\n\\nI say semi-blind, because while I tried to forget which was which by shuffling them, I did still pour them so I may have some inkling. Regardless, that's not what I'm going to focus on in this review - whether or not I could recognize them is secondary to what people actually care about: which is the best?\\n\\nTo do so, I've poured three equal pours into three identical glasses and labeled the bottom of the glass with which is which. I'm going to review each individually and then summarize which I liked the best, to hopefully answer the question: which one should you buy?\\n\\nThe vitals on each whisky: \\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh (Batch 46)**: 60.4% ABV, N^3 (NAS, NCF, NCA), ~€60 for 700ml\\n\\n**Glenfarclas 105**: 60% ABV, N^3, €35 for 1 litre\\n\\n**GlenDronach CS (Batch 3)**: 54.9% ABV, N^3, €70 for 700ml\\n\\nWith the busywork out of the way, onwards, to whisky #1!\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Sherry Bomb #1**  \\n*Speyside, ???*\\n\\n**Nose**: Dark, spicy Oloroso sherry. Somewhat harsh. Dark oak. Orange peel and raisins. Fruitcake. Cherry.\\n\\nDark and brooding are the words I'd use to describe this the most. It's big, that's for sure, but not quite as subtle as it perhaps could be.\\n\\n**Taste**: Thick and viscuous mouthfeel. Juicy toffee and berries. Apricots. Candied red apple. Spicy cinnamon and cloves. Mandarins and raspberry. Light sulphur and leather. \\n\\nThat's really nice. The nose implies this big, heavy oak influence, but the palate is mainly a rush of sweet fruits. Not too wine-y, just excellent overall. \\n\\n**Finish**: Lengthy and prickly. Lightly drying. Spicy cinnamon. Sweet maltiness. Mandarin and orange peel. Oak tannins. Raisin. Young whisky burn.\\n\\nDrier than the palate, with more spices coming out over time. Oak really exerts itself, but so does the youthful component. \\n\\n**Summary**: This is a whisky of two halves - there's clearly some really old, really oaky whisky in this, but there's also some really young whisky - both of which come out the most on the finish.\\n\\nI really do like it, but we'll find out how much compared to the other in just a bit.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Sherry Bomb #2**  \\n*Speyside, ???*\\n\\n**Nose**: Rather harsh. Earthy. Malt. Cardamom. Oak. Dry wine. Mandarin peel. Green grapes. \\n\\nVery different from the first - much less overt sherry, much more malty and earthy. \\n\\n**Taste**: Juicy and dry. Juicy mandarin and apricot. Toffee and malted barley. Earthy spices, cloves and cardamom. Cloudberry and sultanas. Cream. \\n\\nLots of malted barley sweetness, yet clearly sherry aged. Not as old or oaky as the first. \\n\\n**Finish**: Medium length and prickly. Sweet malt. Caramel pudding. Apricot. Oaky sweetness.\\n\\nRather short and uneventful, but not bad.\\n\\n**Summary**: It's interesting to see just how different this one is from the first. Side-by-side, this is much more alcohol-forward and middle-aged, with neither the ups nor the downs of youth or age. This tastes quite even, presenting a single unified profile instead of the mixed profile of the first - I'm guessing this has a much more even age profile than the first.\\n\\nI'm guessing it's all been around 10 years in sherry casks. It's good stuff, but perhaps not as intriguing as the first. \\n\\n----\\n\\n**Sherry Bomb #3**  \\n*Speyside, ???*\\n\\n**Nose**: Apricot. Lemon and mandarin. Raisin. Cloves. Slight salt. Dessert wine.\\n\\nThis is a bit of a mid-way between the first two. It's got some of that balance of the second, but also some of the age of the first. \\n\\n**Taste**: Thick mouthfeel. Juicy apricots. Sweet malt. Toffee. Raspberry. Gummy bears. Sultanas. Golden syrup. Light spiciness. \\n\\nThat's really nice. A wonderfully creamy, syrupy mouthfeel with lots of sweet maltiness and sweet sherry.\\n\\n**Finish**: Medium length. Oak. Touch of earth. Cardamom and cloves. Apricot and peach. Apple peel.\\n\\nLight and fruity throughout - excellent and mouthwatering. \\n\\n**Summary**: Sweet maltiness and dessert wine (think Sauternes) are the hallmarks of this. Really delicious throughout, I'd actually put this as my favourite at this point. It's ludicrously drinkable without being one-note.\\n\\nAdditionally, it doesn't have the young burn of the first, but has more of the complexity of age and heavier sherry influence that the second lacks. Just really well-balanced as a whole.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**The Roundup**\\n\\nThis is just a side-by-side round robin style tasting. No specific notes, just general thoughts written as a train of consciousness. I'm going to do 2 rounds of this, one without water and the other with 2 drops water. \\n\\n*Neat*: \\n\\nThe first is definitely the darkest, driest of these. On the nose, it's got lots of dry oak and wine. On the palate, much juicier, like the other two, but a much younger burn. On the finish, again quite dry with a really harsh young burn.\\n\\nThe second is the maltiest with quite a light sherry influence. On the nose, malty and some apricot, but quite harsh. On the palate, again rather harsh, but more sweet wine influence. Rather dry, but not wine-y on the finish. \\n\\nThe third falls in the middle, with the pronounced sherry influence of the first but also the malt of the second. Not much else to say, it just fits in the middle of the previous two.\\n\\n*With Water*: \\n\\nThe first definitely improves - less harsh young burn, a bit less dry oak. A couple of drops really seems to open it up significantly. \\n\\nThe second gains a distinct note of strawberries on the nose - I don't think that note has ever been as clear for me as it is here. Also some more grapes.\\n\\nThe third turns a bit more earthy on the nose. Sweet malt, too, but nothing too new. Probably skip the water on this one. There's something sour and musty here I can't pinpoint - not bad, just strange. Grape leaves, maybe?\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Reveal**\\n\\n\\\\#1: Aberlour A'bunadh\\n\\n\\\\#2: Glenfarclas 105\\n\\n\\\\#3: GlenDronach CS\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Rankings**\\n\\n1. GlenDronach CS (89/100)\\n\\n2. Aberlour A'bunadh (85/100)\\n\\n3. Glenfarclas 105 (83/100)\\n\\n---- \\n\\n**Final Words**\\n\\nI came into this expecting to be able to pick my undisputed favourite and the One True Sherry Bomb. That didn't happen. Instead, I discovered how different the profiles on all three are. \\n\\nThe Glenfarclas tastes pretty young - most of the whisky in it would probably be pretty close to its old 10 year old age statement that it no longer carries, and the sherry hasn't taken over the malt yet. \\n\\nThe Aberlour tastes like a blend of ages. There's probably some insanely old casks in every batch of A'bunadh, but there's also some really young casks, probably around 5-7. Could you put an age statement on it? I doubt it, because what makes A'bunadh special and interesting is that mix of probably two to three decades' worth of casks.\\n\\nThe GlenDronach is somewhere between the two. I believe it's got the same malty 10-year-old base that the Glenfarclas does, but with some portion of middle-aged (15-20 year old) stock somewhere in the mix, but I don't think there's anything as extremely old as in the A'bunadh.\\n\\nMaybe I'm just romanticizing the whole thing, and the difference is the proportion of first-fill and second-fill casks, their quality and the type of sherry aged in them (Oloroso or PX mostly, I'd venture). \\n\\n----\\n\\nSo, I haven't managed to pick a single cask strength sherry bomb that I'll pick over all the others, but I have managed to pick one I will try to always keep stocked: GlenDronach CS. The others may come and go, and I won't stray from buying them in the future. \\n\\nIf you like sherry and you like cask strength whisky, here's my advice: buy one of these. It doesn't really matter which of them, because they're all really good in their own right.\\n\\nIf you had to pick just one, though, get the GlenDronach. \",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 46** \\n\\nThanks to /u/muaddib99 for the swap.  \\n\\nColour: Dark rusty amber.  \\n\\nNose: Sherry.  Raisins, figs, prunes, cinnamon, wine, wood, rotten cardboard.  There's a definite sour note here, but general rich cask strength sherry matured scotch is what comes through here.\\n\\nPalate: Very sweet, very strong sherry notes.  Incredibly rich upfront.  The sherry-related notes from the nose repeat, as do some spices.  The hot alcohol quickly arrives and really overshadows the incredible notes here, even with water.\\n\\nFinish: While overpowered by the alcohol, wood, spices, and sherry sweetness do linger.\\n\\nThe sherry bomb component here is absolutely incredible, possibly comparable to Macallan CS, however the alcohol overpowers those notes, even with lots of water.  I usually love cask strength whisky, but I can't help but feel like it's too much here.  Perhaps more time in the cask would help?  Compared with the Glenfarclas 105 10 year cask strength, this A'bunadh is sweeter, has darker colour, and a richer palate.

       " \"As many of you know, I live in the Great White Land-of-Provincial-Liquor-Regulation, and our prices for whisky suck. See, the government had this whole prohibition idea, and then when it ended, they decided they still needed to babysit us and ensure we didn't drink too much. Thus was born the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which today has morphed into a retailing giant that spends a ton of money on advertising to increase demand for alcoholic beverages, while maintaining a pricing strategy rooted in deterring demand for alcoholic beverages...also, they're terrible at both. Why do I rant about this in a whisky review? because today I'm reviewing one of the few bottles that is actually priced reasonably in this province!  Aberlour A'bunadh is a sherry-bomb-lovers-wet-dream, and I have the great fortune of reviewing 3 batches side by side today. I bought a bottle a long time ago, and happened to end up with batch 46. A huge thanks to /u/boyd86 for batch 53, which i swapped for back in November 2016, and to /u/slackerdude for the swap of batch#6 that I swapped for in March 2016. No, that wasn't a typo, the slacker came across it randomly on a shelf one day and it was an obvious insta-buy. Apparently someone must have had it on a shelf, saw how it had appreciated in price since it was launched back in 1999. crazy. anyway, on to the cask strength three-way! I'm going to review each element side by side, rather than going one dram at a time. I'll also lay it out in table format rather than bullet points for easy comparison across batches. \\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh | Batch #6 | Batch #46 | Batch #53\\n--------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------\\n**Appearance** | deep reddish orange with fat sexy legs | similar to #6 but slightly less red. | lighter still, but still a pink-orange hue. The legs on this one are incredible.\\n**Nose** | rich fruity nose, lots of berries, cherries, demerara sugar, caramel, red licorice, spices  | quite different than batch 6. much less fruit but somehow more sugary and a lot more oak influence. raspberry, caramel, vanilla, molasses. Less spicy than 6 | sweeter yet than the other two, and a bit more cloying. Not as much spice either.\\n**Palate** | a lot more woodiness than I expected to get. Quite dry, almost tannic, tart, nutty, with a ton of dark dried fruit. Raisins, figs, caramel, molasses. Delicious. A dry sherry bomb. strawberry, chocolate on those strawberries. More oak tannins, dry nutty goodness. wow | much sweeter than batch 6. way more sugary fruit, berries, chocolate,  tons of spice like cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes much more youthful too and runs quite a bit hotter than the older batch.  | very different once again. Doesn't run nearly as hot as batch 46. has more of the nuttiness I expect from oloroso sherry, and it's super dry once again… dries out the mouth like a nice dry wine. Earthy, chocolate, light spiciness, red fruit, caramel, toffee, molasses. \\n**Finish** | long, dry, fruity and not overly sweet.  | medium, hot, spicy, sweet, and slightly bitter | longer than 46. dry, nutty, fruity. \\n**Overall** | This strikes a fantastic balance of some sweetness with a dry tannic character. Tons of flavour and each element shines through without over-powering the others.  | this batch isn't nearly as balanced as #6, and the cloying sweetness overpowers much of the other notes and it runs so hot I feel it needs water, unlike the other two. I previously rated this an 89, but that will be going down now that I've compared to its brethren. | batch 53 thankfully is better than 46 and gets back to the more balanced approach of batch 6. it has some sweetness, along wth a good punch of wood and dry tannic character. I'm having a hard time choosing which I like better, 6 or 53. \\n**Score** | 91 | 84 | 90\\n\\nin the end, I'm choosing batch 6 as my favourite. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and tend to love dry sherried malts, particularly a well done oloroso cask. This one just balances it all beautifully. The 46 is just way too sweet for me to score it as high as I did the first time... maybe my tastes have changed or something. The 53 is delicious and dry, but runs slightly hotter and isn't quite as balanced as 6.  Overall, such an awesome experience seeing the variations between batches.

Sherry is certainly the key flavor here, but my oh my does it work well. The mouth feel on this really is incredible. So thick and oily. \\n  \\nFinish: Decently long finish. Sherry, spice, sherry, spice, and sherry. There is a slight burn that hangs around in a good way.  \\n  \\nScore: 93\\n  \\nThis is certainly one of my favorites. If there ever was a desert whisky, this is it. It's rich and luxurious. Thick and oily in the mouth, rich and complex. I really do need to try some other batches, but this was a fantastic random purchase. Will certainly be replacing it when it's empty. \",\n",

       " \"**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch 47, 60.7% abv, $68**\\n\\n**Nose:** I'm instantly transported to a strawberry field my friend had as a kid. So much strawberry--and very strong, at that. Right down the middle of the nose is delicious strawberry, but alongside it are raspberry, cherry, vanilla, a hint of wildflower, some more strawberry, some fresh cream, and maybe a hint of raisin sweetness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Strawberry first and foremost, followed by a nice vanilla undercurrent of sweetness. A raspberry tartness pops up, and then is pulled back by a lovely black cherry wave. The entire experience is just lightly coated and embraced by vanilla and fresh cream. Brilliant, really.\\n\\n**Finish:** Long, dark fruit. Strawberry stays on the front of the palate, but black cherry lingers on the back. A nice, chewy whisky that doesn't say goodbye too quickly.\\n\\n**Overall:** This is certainly a sherry bomb. Strawberry shortcake is really what comes to mind. At 121.4 proof, it's definitely packed full of flavor. However, it has real flaws, that knock off a few points. I first sampled it neat, wherein the flavor was clearly there, and came with a force. I then cleansed my palate with water and a cracker or two, and added a teaspoon of water to see how this stacks up. At this high of a proof, adding water is certainly not out of the question.\\n\\nAs soon as the water was added, it just completely transformed the whisky, and not into something I'm thrilled with. The strawberry was dealt a death blow, and the nose is now full of cherries--the tartness of strawberry and raspberry is almost completely subdued. The palate has a hint of strawberry, but nothing like it was before. The whisky remains almost flat through the middle and only the peripheral flavors are still present. The vanilla and cream coating is all but gone. A little bit of an oakiness starts shining through, but all the other flavors are nigh non-existent. \\n\\nI'm not sure I've ever had a teaspoon of water change a whisky this much before. The finish is still long, but the strawberry at the front of the palate just isn't there. I can see why they bottle this at cask strength, though--diluting it at all makes it a flat, uninteresting whisky.\\n\\nIf I had just tried it neat, it would have been an 88, and if I had just tried it with the water, it would have been a 75. So, I'm not going to split the difference, but I will take off quite a few marks.\\n\\n**Score:** 83/100\",\n",

I tried a small pour of the 105 a little while afterwards to compare and I feel that it handles the high strength a little better than the A\\'bunadh, which was quite sharp at times.

Happened to move and with the first month\\'s saving from the rent reduction at the new place, I was able to run out and pick up a bottle of the Batch 47 for only $65. So that was nice! Anyway, lets get to the review!!! \\n\\nAgain, any notes in brackets are synesthesia responses. \\n\\n**Appearence:** A red, caramel in colour. Thicker than other drams, but not more viscous, if that makes any sense. long legs. The red is similar in color to rooibos tea. \\n\\n**Nose:** The first reaction is a definitive raisin/date note. Almost makes me think of an armagnac. I\\'m also getting plum in there as well, but much more so on the back, as well as a berry. I\\'ll be honest, the first couple times I smelled this dram, I couldn\\'t help but sigh, it was THAT delicious smelling. I\\'m also picking up the astringent, tanniny notes. Which is interesting considering that it is a sherry finish. The sherry is also very full in the nose, as well as a floral note. Not sure what though... for some reason my mind goes to buttercups, but I am not quite sure if that\\'s the case or not. Dark chocolate fills the \"finish\" of the nose, with a beet undertone. Very complex. \\n\\n**Taste:** First thought: OH WOW IS THIS GOOD!!!  Ok, now for the breakdown lol. I get something reminiscent of white tea at the onset. There is also a berry/plum, date/raisin from the nose present, in a definite maltiness swimming in brown sugar. It\\'s sweet... more than I expected, even knowing it to be sherry finished. I also get a spiciness (cloves?) as well as a unique riciness. Like a good, dry sake. Speaking of Japanese cuisine, I also get hints of mackerel nigiri, but just the pickled fish part, minus the rice. It\\'s not fishiy, thought... if you take away the fishiness, the taste behind it is what I mean. Again, not sure if that made sense, but it is DAMN tasty. Obviously, in all of this, there is a definite sherry tone tying it all together. [mahogany in colour in rounded bursts, chasing with water {not adding water, but following it immediately with water} adds a forest green, cubish sensation]\\n\\n**Finish:** It fills all of the mouth, sort of like a gas (think a thick fog or steam). I get a momentary burst of bananas, not so much a banana taste as much as the mouthfeel of eating bananas. It slowly crawls down the throat. \\n\\nAll in all, I just have one word... DAMN. This was a GREAT dram. I need to check out some of the other batches, from what I understand Batch 47 wasn\\'t even all that great comparatively.

This is an odd one – no not the side-by-side, I guess it's a pretty standard “often recommended cs sherry bomb”-SBS – as I somehow forgot I had these three (yes, there is one more) reviews typed out at the evening of the DFB Cup final between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund some time ago but never posted them. For reasons unknown, or at least forgotten.    \\nAnyway, as there was no introduction mumbojumbo I probably wanted to write a witty and clever introduction but failed to do so. I'm not going to make up for that now, as that would probably take me forever and then I'll forget to post again, so without further ado here's a side by side of two of the most recommended sherry bombs.     \\n***    \\nWhiskyNetworkReview: #105 (hohoho, maybe I was waiting for this?)+106 | r/bourbon: #17 | **r/scotch: #78+79** | r/worldwhisky: #10 | Ø 85\\n***    \\n*** \\nAberlour | A'Bunadh (Batch 47) | NAS | 60.7% | Oloroso Sherry butts | 60€  in Germany |    \\nand    \\nGlenfarclas | 105 | NAS | 60% | Sherry (I think Oloroso, but I'm not sure) | 36€  in Germany |\\n***    \\n**Nose:**    \\nAA: Starts with a bit of a burned rubber/sulfur note as well as tart fruits, but then some sherry notes come through as well as baking spices and some oak, strangely enough the nose reminds me a bit of a high proof rye. Weird! There are tart fruits like green apples as well as cherries underneath that though. Over time these fruity notes take more and more room. Needs some time/air to open up, then mostly all of the rubber/sulfur is gone and the nose is quite nice with strong vanilla and honey notes.     \\n\\n105: Different but with a similar backbone: strong medium dry Sherry notes (fresh dough, grapes, a bit fermented cereals and baking spices) at the front combined with honey and wood, also a slight burned rubber/sulphur note (a bit stronger than in the AA). Over time some more fruit notes develop but the sulfur gets a bit too overpowering for me. Meh.\\n\\n\\n**Taste:**    \\nAA: very creamy and sweet entry, nice spicy abv bits, honey, roast apple (Bratapfel), marzipan, nuts and some ripe green grapes, noticeable but little oak      \\n\\n105: The entry is also creamy but a bit less then with the AA. Overall this is a bit less sweet then the AA, even though this has more milk chocolate notes but less sugary/honey sweetness. Raisins, cake frosting and nice strawberry notes, shows clearly more wood influence then the AA. I think I read this is in the 8-10 years range, which sounds probable. The abv needs a little more time to develop its spicy bites which start shortly before the Finish.    \\n\\n**Finish:**     \\nAA:  looooong, dark kind of honey, there are tart fruity aspects below it nicely adding another dimension and depth to it, baking spices as well fierce peppery abv bites, drying at the end.     \\n\\n105: The finish is then dominated by a spicy combination of cinnamon and pepper as well as honey. Sweet oranges a bit like Java Cake stroll along the way. Long and pretty similar to the A'bunadh.    \\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe Aberlour is a wee bit bolder but also simpler, the 105 is more refined as it has more depth but to me, is also less powerful. The nose of the 105 really put me off but the rest made up for it pretty nicely! And it comes at a price here in Europe which is hardly beat. I'd say only by Lagavulin Costo prices.     \\nThe A'bunadh can't deny its relation to the 12 NCF. I haven't had that for a long time but I would say that I prefered the NCF a small bit because it has a bit more complexity and depth. Still a very solid B. It needs some time to open up but then it's very comforting, warm and decadent. A bit simple though, but still nice.  \\nMore recently, I'd take the Glendronach CS over all three of them (NCF, A'b, 105). Speaking of which, wasn't there a sample in the mail? Oh yeah, some Glendronach Sauternes Finish /u/SparkTrader send! Yummi!     \\nOh, wait! Let's finish this one first. So, how would I rate them?

I'd warn, with this batch at least, don't get too zealous adding water, it breaks down a little if taken below 50% abv. Try it at full strength and add <2.5ml at a time until it's to your taste.\\n\\nTypically heralded as 'the' introductory sherry bomb, I'd call it more of a sherry glass cannon, because I feel like there's young whisky, or at least, harsh whisky, in this that can at times get in the way of the more subtle, and, in my opinion, better notes, and it's easily drowned with too much water. Still, this is excellent overall, especially considering the price. And I have to say, this is a haunting dram: just reading over my post to check for spelling mistakes, I can taste and smell it in my mind more than any other scotch I've had so far, this is the one I'm excited to go home and drink in the evenings. \\n\\nI probably won't be buying another bottle anytime soon, simply because there's too much other stuff to try, but I can see myself picking up a new one when batch 48 comes out. \\n\\n* **Score**: 90/100\",\n",

Lightly bittersweet like crushed cherry pits. White pepper like heat, rehydrated dried cherries in red wine. (w/ water) Tones down the white pepper heat, more drying, more dark chocolate covered raisins/cranberries/cherries paired with a sweet red wine.\\n\\n**Finish** - (w/o water) Lingering hint of bitter, sweet gentle heat, fading rehydrated cherries/cranberries in red wine.

Very much a sherry bomb whisky and very tasty. A tiny bit of water opens it up a bit by mellowing out some of the spice from the higher proof and I think I prefer it that way as it softens it up and makes it a bit less cloyingly sweet.\\n\\n---\\nWhiskey Network Review #99\\n\\nEDIT: Apparently I can't even read from the bottle\",\n",

Half a minute or so after the last drop, my mouth tastes like I've been running my tongue along a slab of charred wood.\\n\\n* Rating - 9/10\\n\\n* Comments - Delicious. The sherry notes are very prominent in the nose - the citrus, raisins, apples and plums are all front and centre. I noted some citrus in the 10 year, but nothing on par with the orange notes in this malt, or the other fruits for that matter. The taste of this one is much more sharp and refined than the 10 year, probably owing to being bottled at cask strength. I definitely noticed smoke and peat influences but they don't quite dominate .

The finish is where the strong abv is most apparent.\\n\\n* Rating - 8/10\\n\\n* Comments - My first time trying a cask strength malt. An explosion of fruit and dessert flavours like I've never experienced in any alcohol before, let alone whisky. Rich and complex yet still packing a huge punch. At times overwhelming, don't think I could have more than one before needing to pour something else from some other part of the malt spectrum. A nice change of pace from the three Islay bottles I had before it for sure. Having finished the bottle, I began to tire of it after finishing about half of it. I don't think the whisky itself changed, but the sherry bomb aspect of it can become quite overpowering after drinking it once or twice a week for two months, which made me long for other flavours, but I didn't want to buy a new bottle before I finished it.\\n\\n#12 \\n\\nGlenmorangie Quinta Ruban\\n\\nHighland\\n\\nDecember 29, 2015\\n\\nSample bottle for Christmas \\n\\n* Colour - Reddish brown \\n\\n* Nose - Oranges, molasses, milk chocolate, bit of vanilla and cinnamon.\\n\\n* Taste - Oranges, tangerines, pepper, walnuts, faint mint and a tannin-like quality.\\n\\n* Finish - Pepper comes through strong with hints of mint and nuts. \\n\\n* Rating - 8/10\\n\\n* Comments - Enjoyable, the port finish wasn't as sweet as I expected.

       " \"I've reviewed a bunch of batches of A'bunadh in the past and have noticed a downward trend.  I found [this blog post](https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/2015/12/07/aberlour-abunadh-batch-49/) awhile back and decided I needed to try batch 49.  I won a bottle at auction for not much more than retail.  And it arrived at around the same time as I got a sample of batch 60 from an [online retailer](www.whiskysite.nl).  I had a bit of my batch 61 left to compare against, which is my least favorite batch so far.  So hopefully they are both better than that.  Batch 49 ABV = 60.1% and Batch 60 ABV = 60.3%.  Batch 49 is a shade or two darker than batch 60.  Non chill-filtered and no added color.\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Nose:**  Rich, sweet, earthy, and nutty.  Brown sugar.  Almonds.  Marzipan.  Menthol.  Hazelnuts.  Cocoa.  Leather.\\n\\n**Batch 60 Nose:**  Sweet, clean, nutty.  Ethanol heat.  Sugar syrup.  Apples.  Caramel.  Pine sap.  Pinesol.  Younger, hotter, and less rich on the nose than batch 49.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Palate:**  Rich, thick, creamy mouthfeel.  Turbinado sugar.  Earth.  Leather.  Caramel.  Toffee.  Almonds.  Nutella.  Earth.  \\n\\n**Batch 60 Palate:**  Rich, thick, syrupy mouthfeel.  Sweeter.  Sugar syrup.  Ethanol heat.  Chocolate.  Toffee.  Almond bark.  Adding a few drops of water really helps the palate on this.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Finish:**  Medium long finish.  Earthy and rich.  Still an underlying caramelized sugar.  But all about the leather and earth and nuts.  Subtle black pepper.  A bit of old oak spice.\\n\\n**Batch 60 Finish:**  Medium long finish.  The sweetness carries through.  Here we get more earth.  Leather.  Black pepper.  Subtle nuttiness.  A bit bitter.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Score:** 91/100\\n\\n**Batch 60 Score:** 88/100\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis was super fun.  I think that batch 49 is indeed the best I've had so far.  Absolutely delicious.  It has everything that makes A'bunadh my favorite sherry bomb - the richness, the nuttiness, the earthiness, without tasting too young or sweet.  That said, batch 60 was actually very good as well.  Better than the batch 61 that I had a bottle of, that's for sure.  It tastes younger for sure.  And sweeter.  But less complex and less nutty and earthy.  Batch 61 seems even hotter and younger than 60 to me.  All of them are slightly improved with a few drops of water, as well.\\n\\nSo overall, I really think that 40s > 50s > 60s, at least for my palate.  One of these days I'm gonna have to splurge on some earlier 20s and 30s batches.  Batch 60 and 61 and quite a bit sweeter, and I know plenty of people get their kicks from sweet as hell sherry bombs.  So these may be better for you.  But for me tastes, I love the nutty earthy 40s batches.  And I'll do my best to buy a few more while I can.\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'Aberlour'\",\n",
       " '**Aberlour A’Bunadh Batch 49 Review**\\n\\nAberlour A’Bunadh is a scotch I heard about when I started getting serious about whisky. It came across in a number of top 10 lists I was researching along with glowing reviews here on /r/Scotch. So there was no hesitation on my part to buy a bottle without having tasted even a sniff of a dram.  \\n\\nIf you aren’t familiar with Aberlour A’Bunadh, it’s a batched release. Although I haven’t tasted any other batches, apparently each batch has slight variations resulting in some batches being somewhat better than others. It’s a sherry casked scotch that isn’t chill filtered and is at cask strength. I purchased one from the 49th batch which is 60% ABV.\\n\\nOn to the review!\\n\\n**Type:** Single Malt Scotch\\n\\n**ABV:** 60%\\n\\n**Presentation:** I typically have 3-5 drams over a period of weeks before posting my tasting notes. My latest dram was neat in a Canadian Glencairn glass while watching Scrooged on the big screen with the family.\\n\\n**Appearance & Colour:** Amber, thick & oily.\\n\\n**Nose:** Fruity in a red wine sort of way. Clearly the sherry coming through. Surprisingly no trace of alcohol in the nose. The nose was a bit faint though, not overwhelming. 20/25\\n\\n**Palate:** Christmas spice with candied fruit. Like a faint christmas fruitcake. Moderate sweetness on the tongue. Then a gradual warmth comes into the picture. 25/25\\n\\n**Finish:** Gloriously long and warm. Nice faint sangria aftertaste. Again the sherry coming through. 25/25\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nSo good! This is my special occasion dram that I plan to tease out over several years. Something I’d break out during holidays and birthdays. The first dram out of the bottle was a bit of a poke in the nose. But subsequent pours were more civil. The amazing thing about this bottle is that even though it’s 60% ABV, it doesn’t punch you in the face with alcohol. The higher ABV doesn’t show itself until the finish. Even when it does, it slips in gradually. A definite must in any aficionado’s shelf. 25/25\\n\\n**Score:** 95/100\\n\\n**Buy? Try? Or Avoid?:** Buy!\\n\\n*Note: This is my first review here on /r/Scotch but my fourth review overall on the whisky network.*',\n",

Full mouthfeel, I think?  \\n\\nWater Taste: Slight burn still, slight bitter, sherry wine, fig, some dried berry. Light to medium mouthfeel.  \\n\\nFinish: Once the burn is gone I get light marzipan, date and more chocolate. Long length. \\n\\nWater Finish: the bitter fades and sherry comes back stronger, stays sweet and the malt holds. Short length \\n\\nNotes: Without water the alcohol burn kills most of the taste and makes this near undrinkable. I almost never add water to my CS whiskeys but the heat in this was too much. Even after the heat was a little dissipated it wasn't a good drink. Maybe if this opens up a bit it'll be better but at my sampling it was very unpleasant. I have had previous batches of the A'Bunadh that were very nice and I would score in the mid 80s, Batch 42 and 47 stand out so I'm going to chalk this up to a bad batch.\\n \\n75/100  \",\n",

I am suddenly super interested in getting my hands on a sample of the distillery edition of Glenfiddich 15 which is bottled at 51% and non-chill filtered.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n\\n**Laphroaig Quarter Cask** \\n\\n\\n**Nose**- Definitely Laphroaig!  There is a sweet molasses on the nose that isn’t in the 10yo and it’s less medicinal.  Still plenty of peat.\\n\\n **Palate**- This is noticeably sweeter than the 10yo with vanilla and caramel notes in with sea salt, peat, and band-aids.\\n\\n**Finish**- it ends somewhat hot with that sugar molasses behind peat smoke.  It is Laphroaig long in length.\\n\\n**Overall**- I tasted this side by side with the 10yo for calibration & comparison.  I was surprised how sweet such a powerful peated expression could be.  The main takeaway is that this is nice and sweet without losing much of the “Laphroaigness” that I love.  It does lose some of the iodine/hospital notes from the nose, however.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Mods, please upgrade my flair!',\n",
       " \"Review #3 on r/Scotch\\n\\nLong time Scotch drinker, but still new to putting my thoughts and notes out there for public consumption. I welcome your feedback on my notes, my palate, and my reviewing style.\\n\\n**ABERLOUR A'BUNADH LOT #50**\\n**ABV:** 59.6%\\n**Bottle Opened:** 2 months\\n**Pour:** 2oz in a glencairn\\n**H2O:** A few drops of water, see review\\n**Source:** Purchased locally for 75 USD\\n\\n**Tasting methodology:**\\nI pour neat into a glencairn at room temp and promptly shove my nose in the glass for a first impression. After a moment I take my first sip, again, just looking for first impressions.\\n\\nI then let the glass sit for 10 minutes or so and come back for a more thoughtful examination. After several sips neat, I sometimes add a few drops of water. If this is the case, I will note it in the review.\\n\\n**Color:**\\nGorgeous Grade B Maple syrup with burnished bronze, and ruby highlights. Crystal clear. No sediment.\\n\\n**First Impression:**\\nSherry and heat. Blindfolded and with a cold I could tell this spends a good amount of time in sherry and is bottled at cask strength. First sip is hot, but not painful. Lots of rich red wine from the sherry, and the accompanying raisin, dried fruit and leather. Obviously not chill filtered. Finish is sweet and strong with the high proof clearing the sinuses a bit.\\n\\n**After 10 minutes:**\\nStill a strong hit of ethanol heat on the nose, but under it is rich spice cake, roasted malt, sticky raisins, and something like brown sugar and fresh butter slowly melting on a perfectly toasted piece of dense, dark bread. Sherry always present, but not over-powering. Oak tannin balances the sweetness very well. Rich, full mouthfeel.\\n\\n**Finish:**\\nBeautiful lingering finish. Very round, deep, and... red??? (boy that sounds silly, but it's the only way to describe it) As it fades, it leaves some heat on the lips and dryness on the tongue.\\n\\n**After a few drops of water:**\\nAt almost 60%, this can use a drop or two to tame it a bit. I love it full-on, but I also know water can open up some nuances. The nose gets more balanced after the H2O, less heat, more rich malt, dried fruit, leather. Palate is also less hot. Pick up a hint of roasted nuttiness and a peppery spiciness. Finish a bit shorter and milder.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\nA complex, heavy-sherry malt. Lots going on and wonderful to explore in a glass. I'm only about 1/2 way into this bottle, and it is my first A'bunadh, so I will certainly seek out more. I realize the 50 doesn't rate as high as others to many folks, so I look forward to trying other batches as well.\\n\\n**NOTE:**\\nThis bottle has changed a bit since I first opened it a couple months ago. The first pour was a much hotter, single-note, sherry-bomb. Some open time in a cool, dark cabinet has allowed this to open up, oxidize, and mellow a bit. I enjoy it much more now, and look forward to seeing what happens as more time passes. Likely would have rated it as much as 10 points lower based only on the first dram after opening.\\n\\n**Scoring**\\n- First Impression: 90/100\\n- Nose: 92/100\\n- Palate: 90/100\\n- Finish: 88/100\\n\\n**Final Score: 90/100**\\n\\n**Scoring Interpretation:**\\n- **0-49** What is this? Yuck! Is this a joke?! Did I lose a bet?!\\n\\n- **50-59** Only suitable for mixing, or cleaning engine parts.\\n\\n- **60-69** Meh... glad I tried it so I have the palate experience, but I'm not gonna chase this down.\\n\\n- **70-79** Solid drink. Very enjoyable. Nothing to get overwrought about, but hell yes, I'd drink this any time.\\n\\n- **80-89** Fantastic! I want a bottle on my bar all the time.\\n\\n- **90-94** Truly amazing. A special treat I probably can't afford on a regular basis, but will savor when I can.\\n\\n- **95-100** Have yet to taste something I'd rate here. Ever optimistic I guess.\\n\\nThanks for reading. Again, I welcome any feedback you might have. Next up, a personal favorite, and a favorite on this board, Ardbeg Uigeadail.\\n\\n~Cheers!\",\n",

       " \"Hello, this is my first ever review and I thought I’d start off by reviewing my favorite bottle, the Aberlour A’Bunadh (batch 50). Any feedback or criticism is appreciated.\\n\\nFirst some background: I used to hate liquor. In fact I hated liquor until July of this year. Even the slightest proof alcohol made me want to gag and vomit. But in July I forced myself to slowly sip my way through a bottle of bourbon and now 2 months later I’ve gone from 0 bottles to 21. Whoops. So anyway the point of this is that I’m still new, my palate and nose are still developing, and I still have a looooot of whisky to experience. But I feel strongly enough about the A’Bunadh to feel comfortable reviewing it. So on to the actual review:\\n\\nThis batch is bottled at 59.6% ABV and is being enjoyed neat out of a glencairn\\n\\n* Nose: Lots of dark fruits. Plenty that I can’t identify but I strongly sense raisins and figs, maybe some cherry. I also get a hint of wine. Toffee and chocolate round out what my nose is able to detect.\\n\\n* Palate: This thing is a serious wave. When it hits my mouth I get much more of the dark fruits I detected in the nose. The chocolate translates from the nose to the tastebuds too. Delicious and sweet, the initial hit tastes like a fruity dessert. A couple seconds later there’s an explosion of spices. It literally feels like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. It heats my tongue up and covers it in a comforting oily blanket of heat and spice… this drink will definitely be a staple for me in the cold winter months. If I had to sum up the palate of this, I would describe it as biting into a freshly baked spiced cherry pie. Fruity and spicy. Massive explosion of flavor. \\n\\n* Finish: Long and warm. The spices linger as the fruit fades.\\n\\nOverall, this blew me away. I never in my life thought that alcohol could provide these kinds of sensations. It’s beautiful. The intense wave of heat does make it difficult for me to identify too many flavors outside of the generic “spices, fruit, chocolate” but man this is a great drink and that heat wave to me is one of the best things about it, though I’ve seen others disagree. I know that I am only at the very beginning of many years of whisky exploration but this seems like a perfect way to begin it. \\n\\n* My score for the A'Bunadh batch 50: 90/100\",\n",

Molasses, toffee. Tobacco. Tea. Hay. Damp earth. Warm sand. New leather. Almonds and ginger. **With Water:** even more fruit, some orange! Wow. A bit more spice, too. \\n\\n**Taste:** dried dark fruits and sherry. A bit of ginger spiciness. Molasses. Toffee. Tobacco. Strong black tea. Chocolate. Earthy. Medium-thick mouthfeel. Oily. **With Water:** more fruit here too. Some orange rind now. \\n\\n**Finish:** burst of sherry and dark fruits. Creamy. More molasses and toffee. Tobacco. Chocolate. Earthy, a bit grassy. Some new leather. Some light spiciness. Medium length. **With Water:** more fruit and cream, more molasses, more earth. Bigger overall. Very nice.\\n\\n**Score:** 7\\n\\n**Summary:** this is a rich, dark sherry bomb. Tons of beautiful fruits covered in molasses. Some nice notes of tobacco, hay, damp earth, and even a bit mineral. Nutty, with a mild spice throughout. Mouthfeel is quite good, and the finish is excellent. Overall a great dram, and it works really well neat even at almost 60% ABV. A touch of water (really, just a few drops here) brings more fruit and spice, keeping the beautiful mouthfeel and finish.\\n\\nThis is not my typical flavor profile, and as such this bottle tends to sit on the shelf sad and alone. And that's a shame. I should drink it more often.\\n\\nAlso, I suspect my wife thinks I'm underrating this one. She keeps coming back and stealing the last bits of it.\\n\\n**Would I buy a bottle?** yup. I have before, and I would again.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Aberlour A'Bunadh batch #61\\n\\n* NAS, bottled in 2017\\n* 60.8% ABV, cask strength\\n* Non-chill filtered\\n* Likely natural color, but not stated\\n* Oloroso sherry butts\\n\\n**Nose:** raisins & figs.

More resin.\\n\\n**Taste:** dark fruits and sherry. Ginger spice. Almonds. Tobacco. Earthy. Lots of leather. Grassy. A bit hot and a little dry. **With Water:** a bit thinner. Less spice. Nicely fruity. The heat is tamed. Less leather.\\n\\n**Finish:** sweet dried fruits. New leather. Ginger heat. Lots of almonds and tobacco. Toffee and chocolate. Medium length, though shorter than the 50 for sure. A bit hot. A little dry. **With Water:** less leather. More spice. Less heat. More nuts. Sadly shorter.\\n\\n**Score:** 6\\n\\n**Summary:** this is still a big sherry bomb, but it's a different character. (More below.) Lots of nice dark sweet fruits and leather, with some tobacco, vanilla, nuts, and caramel along for the ride. The nose is a bit shy, even with water, and sadly water thinned the mouthfeel out a bit. Water did bring it into better balance, though, and knocked back some of the leather and heat. Still much more leathery than the 50.\\n\\nI usually think of A'Bunadh as a prime example of a high-ABV dram that just doesn't need water. The 61 is letting me down on that a bit though. It's rather hot neat, and oddly balanced.\\n\\n**Would I buy a bottle?** hmm. I'd dig for an older batch honestly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison\\n\\n**Order:** 50 > 61\\n\\nThis is a really easy call. The 50 is big, rich, dark, thick, and just delicious. The 61 is softer, thinner, not as fruity, and much more leathery. A simpler flavor profile all around. More nutty, more vanilla and caramel. The 61 also feels hotter all around than the 50. I'd add water by default to the 61, but I'm happy to have the 50 neat.\\n\\nThis also used to be quite a bargain. I feel like the Batch 50 I have cost me around $70 or so in 2015. I see now it's going for $95 at my local Total Wine, and it's not clear which batch that is. I think I'd be fine with $95 for the 50 honestly.

       " \"I just received a sample of Aberlour A’bunadh (batch 52) from u/cawls in my first ever swap, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to for a head-to-head review of two cask strength sherry bombs: his A’bunadh versus my Glenfarclas 105. Let’s go to the tape. \\n\\nAberlour A’bunadh batch 52: Speyside, 60.5%, non-chillfiltered and I believe uncolored as well. Would cost me about $80. \\n\\nGlenfarclas 105 (NAS version): Speyside, 60%. Doesn’t specify but likely non-chillfiltered; however, it is apparently colored. Got this bottle for $31 overseas, but would cost me near $100 in the US.  \\n\\nPoured about an ounce of each into glencairns, rested 10-15 minutes. \\n\\n* Color: I don’t usually note anything, but the A’bunadh definitely has a richer color even though it is (I read) uncolored. \\n\\n* (A’bunadh) Nose: Heavy alcohol, raisins, prunes, loads of cinnamon, maybe allspice, cake of some kind. With water, the spice deepens if anything, a hint of burnt matches\\n\\n* (Glenfarclas) Nose: Strong alcohol, burnt matches, tangerines, a little wax. Not much difference with water.\\n\\nA'bunadh a clear winner by a nose (sorry, couldn’t help it)\\n\\n* (A) Palate: Comparatively mild despite the slightly higher ABV. Plum cake, hazelnuts, cinnamon buns, a tangy note of something, molasses. With water: the rough edges are smoothed down, a little sweeter and nuttier. There's serious depth to the flavor. Really tasty. \\n\\n* (G) Palate: Very hot initially. Orange marmalade, walnut fudge, a little honey, something floral I can't really place. The alcohol is quite overpowering. With water: less harsh and more chocolatey, not quite as much orange, maybe something like date nut bars.\\n\\nPretty close here, but I think the A’bunadh has more complexity. Both benefit from some water in my opinion. \\n\\n* (A) Finish: Long and warm, more cinnamon buns, plum sauce, a little espresso, not too sweet, not too bitter.\\n\\n* (G) Finish: Long, sweet, orange creamsicle, honey and walnuts, sort of like a granola bar. Burnt matches poke through again. Quite astringent. \\n\\nA'bunadh edges ahead again. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Both are good, but I'll have to give the nod to the A'bunadh. The fudge notes in the Glenfarclas are very nice, but ultimately the greater complexity in nose and finish put A'bunadh ahead in my opinion. Unfortunately I finished up my GlenDronach CS a while back so I couldn't do a three-way comparison (considering the ABV on those it might be for the best that I couldn't), but I think I'd put A'bunadh slightly ahead of that.\\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh > GlenDronach CS > Glenfarclas 105\\n\\nMy opinion. All three have their charms and I'd be happy to drink any of them. \\n\\n**Buy a bottle?** A’bunadh definitely made the list. The 105 is good, but probably won’t be a repeat buy at US prices. \\n\\nA’bunadh: 88/100\\n\\n105: 85/100\\n\\nCan I get my next tartan please?\\n\",\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 53 (Speyside) - 59.5% ABV - $99.95 (LCBO)** \\n\\n**Nose:** Nosed neat this is a dram that will come at you hard.  Not purely alcohol, but big, fruity, sherry notes.  Big notes of cherry, plum and raisins complemented by a lively honey and toffee sweetness.  Recommend taking down the ABV with a bit of water to let some of the subtler notes come through.  With water the spice on the nose really comes alive, with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice making an appearance.  Hints of chocolate and candied ginger also make an appearance.\\n\\n**Palate:** Oof, this is a banger!  The palate doesn’t contain a lot of mystery after the experience of the nose.  Incredibly rich and creamy, slightly oily and viscous, it delivers fully on the nose’s sherry bomb promise.  The cherry from the nose is present, but less pronounced, allowing those darker, dried-fruit notes to really come to the fore.  Raisins, figs, plums and pear really steal the show.  The honey/molasses sweetness and light chocolate notes remain, but don’t overwhelm or hold a candle to the fruit.  Through the development the spicy background notes come to the fore, with the cinnamon and nutmeg carrying you through the fading sweetness of the arrival.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Long, lingering and satisfying.  The spicy and dried fruit notes hang in there for as long as you care to savour them without the blanket sweetness of the arrival.  Truly lovely and soul-warming.\\n\\n**Score:** 89/100\\n\\nA’bunadh - Of the Origins - This was the first true sherry bomb whisky I tried, the original if you will, and it remains my favorite.  It still holds true that you have to be in the right mood to truly enjoy this, but that’s true of most scotches.  If you wanted a dram that was light and refreshing you would never reach for this bottle.  However, when I wanted something that is big, bold, warming, and a little sweet, this is often my first choice. \\n\\nAt roughly 60% abv this isn’t for the faint of heart neat, but it is very drinkable that way, if you choose.  For it’s strength and the fact that it’s a non-age statement whisky, that’s no mean feat.  \\n\\nI make no secret of the fact that I’m a big fan of Aberlour distillery in general, and it’s because they produce whiskies like this.  Do I enjoy some of their releases more than others?  Of course.  That said, I can’t think of many instances (if any) where I’ve picked up one of their bottles and been horribly disappointed.

Not only do I now believe in [ghosts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4eur4h/review_9_aberlour_12/d28x790), but I had an amazing time and it’s like you did this with me haha!  Big shoutout to u/WDMC-905 for the sample of the Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso and for making this review even longer.  I don’t have much to add really as this is getting pretty long.  I do however, want to say that I think this has helped me to not only understand the differences between distilleries and the variations that you can have with sherry matured scotch, but to also conquer my obsession with sherry.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 53**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nRested 10 minutes - Glencairn.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* **Price**: $99 at the LCBO\\n* **Region**: Speyside\\n* **Abv**: 59.7%\\n\\n\\n* **Colour**: like an English ale\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose**: neat - spices, typical sherry red fruits. Very solid nose and true to form for what I would expect in a Sherry bomb. Hits that comfort spot. Breathing in deeply I get some woody notes, some light toffee sweetness and a hint of a floral perfume. Without water it\\'s very approachable, especially considering this is 59.7%. I was getting this really sweet note that I couldn\\'t identify at first but I think it\\'s candy apple.\\n\\nWith some water the nose is very gentle, the spice and sherry gets toned down so that more of the toffee comes out. Candy Apple turns to cotton candy (that sickly sweet note). \\n\\n\\n**Taste**: neat - very spicy with the same Sherry notes underneath that dominating spice. Some wood. This is a bit closed so I think it would benefit from some water. \\n\\nWith water the spice is toned down immediately so that more of the sherry comes out. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy but not as think is I would have thought. With time this becomes very juicy and mouthwatering. Apple juice prominent. \\n\\n**Finish**: oak, spice, dry and toffee. Medium long length and very drying. Very standard but solid finish. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Thoughts**: this is everything I would want in a Sherry bomb. Hits all the notes I would expect. Very spicy dram and sometimes it detracts from the great Sherry notes. In Ontario, this is a great value for money. My baseline right now for Sherry bombs would be the GlenDronach Single Casks or GlenDronach Cask Strength. This doesn\\'t hit those levels but it\\'s a good dram, very \"text book\" and I would be happy to have a bottle if not for all the fantastic Single Casks out there. The juicy notes that started to appear after some time and water really are my favourite part and elevates it above \"just a Sherry bomb\". \\n\\n\\n**Score**\\n>**86/100**\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Glenfarclas 105**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRested 10 minutes - Glencairn with a few drops of water.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* **Price**: $110 at the LCBO\\n* **Region**: Speyside\\n* **Abv**: 60.0%\\n\\n\\n* **Colour**: warmed honey\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose**: Very strong and syrupy red fruit, like maraschino cherry syrup.  Mulling spice and a bit of sherry funk.  Exactly what you would expect from a sherry bomb, with some more emphasis on the cherry, as opposed to the A’bunadh.\\n\\n\\n**Taste**: cherries, vanilla, mulling spices. Surprisingly dry when compared to the nose, which was very syrupy.  With time the cherry syrup is more dominant.\\n\\n**Finish**: drying, some oak, cherries, vanilla, spices. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Thoughts**: Not complex overall and really hits your textbook sherry notes, but what it does hit, it does so with a vengeance.  I do love the tilt towards cherry.  The selling point for me is the intensity of flavours.  Admittedly, it is a far cry from the more complex sherried drams I’ve had, such as the Glendro Single Casks but I’m not complaining and if price were no issue I’d take this just over the A’bunadh.\\n\\n**Score**\\n>**86.5/100**\\n',\n",
       " 'Aberlour A’bunadh (“the Original”) has, until recently, been a darling of Scotchit-- a massive sherry bomb and prime example of NAS done tastefully, with lots of reviews and fairly high accolades. There seems to be a general consensus, though, that the spirit has declined in quality over time. Adding insult to that perceived injury was Pernod Ricard’s decision to hike the price significantly in mid-2018-- while it cost around $80 locally for me only a year ago, a bottle of A’bunadh now costs close to $110. \\n\\nOne of the debates that I see threaded through the general quality dip is how much batch variation actually exists in the A’bunadh line-- how much of this comes down to ‘golden’ or ‘dud’ batches, and whether exposure to air or time opened makes a difference. There are lots of comparison reviews of A’bunadh for this reason, with reviewers seeking out subtle (or not-so-subtle) differences. Others claim that there is no really significant change between batches. \\n\\nAfter trying Aberlour 12 NCF earlier this year and enjoying it, I decided to leap to A’bunadh and went looking for different batches locally. Most of what I saw was between batches 60 and 62, but being interested in harder-to-get bottles I looked for and eventually found a slightly older one-- batch 53, from 2015. A little while later I found another bottle at a different store, batch 44 from 2012. Batches of A’bunadh vary slightly in ABV, but both of these were the exact same at 59.7%. To satiate some of my curiosity, I decided to pick up the 44 and open them both at the same time, keeping their fill levels relatively similar over time. As always, I try to reflect in this review my experience with the whisky over time and how things change.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Aberlour A’bunadh, Batch 44\\n\\nbottled 2012\\n\\n###Aberlour A’bunadh, Batch 53\\n\\nbottled 2015\\n\\nBoth 750mL bottles, 59.7% ABV, NCF ~ $83 USD each.\\n\\nTime scale: uncapped at the same time and open around five months, tasting notes taken:\\n\\n* **just beneath the shoulder,**\\n\\n* and beneath the ½ mark.\\n\\n*(no significant changes at the heel)*\\n\\n|Batch 44|Batch 53|\\n|-|-|\\n|Nose: **loads of oak, sweetened dark chocolate, a faint hint of burnt matches, very dark fruits (stewed blackberries), with time in the glass fruits begin to come forward,** vanilla custard, dark cherries in the background. |Nose: **stewed red fruits, dark cherries, blackberry jam, nutmeg, cherry cordials, cinnamon gum, milk chocolate.**|\\n|Palate: **dark cherries, more tannic oak.**|Palate: **BIG sherry spices, earth and dead leaves (like a forest floor), herbal spice in the background.**|\\n|Finish: **long ~ sherry spices, even more tannic oak/wood spice, very drying, bitter dark chocolate, a faint hint of acetone,** acetone comes a bit more forward as time passes. |Finish: **medium-long ~ lots of wood spice mingling with more cinnamon, menthol, nutmeg,** a wave of cherry cordial.|\\n|Bottle thoughts: Wooden core throughout at first, with some fruit and chocolate coming forward later on with time to open up. Decent, but this remains super oaky, not at all what I expect in a sherry bomb. The nose promises more than the palate delivers, and the acetone on the finish is definitely not great. Fairly consistent across the life of the bottle with few changes-- something more coming out of the oakiness might have been a welcome change. |Bottle thoughts: Now this is more like it-- sherry driven through and through. One of the things I love about this is the way the cinnamon-cherry-herbal wave spreads like wildfire across the tongue. This has none of the wood-driven character of #44; the wood is still in there, but it’s taking a back seat and letting other interesting things come forward. Relatively simple but powerful profile. Extraordinarily consistent across the life of the bottle, and when the flavors pack a punch like this, that’s a very good thing.|\\n|Score: **6½** |Score: **8+** |\\n\\n*****\\n\\nOn takeaway, huge difference between these two batches despite identical ABV and identical air exposure. Granted, my methods aren’t bulletproof by any means-- it’s a tiny sampling, doesn’t look at older or more recent bottlings, and there are a bunch of things that can’t be factored in like handling of the bottles before purchase, etc., but I thought I’d try to give a different take on this debate. It surprised me that I liked a batch in the 50s so much more than a batch in the 40s, and that the latter had many of the woody/chocolaty qualities I have seen others describe as detrimental to the more recent batches. \\n\\nBased on this experience I feel that A’bunadh has considerable variation between batches, not just due to exposure or ABV differences. That said, the general profile is simple and sherry-driven enough that sampling it from time to time like a sane person (rather than comparing full bottles head-to-head like this) most likely presents a similar experience across batches. I may have scored these radically differently, but that’s over five months of sampling and side-by-side comparison-- I think I would be unlikely to notice those differences or highlight them the same way if these were one-time bar pours. For reference, I have also had batches 58 and 60 in bars, and although admittedly hard to compare directly to a bottle at home, I don’t remember any significant qualitative differences in the experience of either one.\\n\\nI wouldn’t pay $110 to have either of these again, but I did buy another bottle of the old 12 NCF at $63. That absolutely satiates my Aberlour desires for now.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAbout my scoring: I’ve settled into a 10-point scale by half-points, with a little room for fudging (+/-) I’ll keep tweaking it as I go. \\n\\n**10** ~ Outstanding, transcendent\\n\\n**9** ~ Excellent, complex, balanced and flavorful ^*Laphroaig* ^*10* ^*CS*\\n\\n**8** ~ Great, eminently enjoyable ^*Oban* ^*18*\\n\\n**7** ~ Good and solid ^*Aultmore* ^*12*\\n\\n**6** ~ Decent, above average ^*Monkey* ^*Shoulder*\\n\\n**5** ~ Average, uninspiring, drinkable ^*Compass* ^*Box* ^*G.K.S.* ^*Glasgow*\\n\\n**4** ~ Below average, not connecting ^*Tobermory* ^*10*\\n\\n**3** ~ Subpar, unpleasant ^*Johnnie* ^*Walker* ^*Ultimate* ^*18*\\n\\n**2** ~ Distasteful\\n\\n**1** ~ Impressively nasty',\n",
       " \"**Aberlour A'Bunadh Batch 53; 59.7% ABV**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nFriday night review spree part 2: A'bunadh Batch 53. This whisky is indubitably the most underrepresented spirit on this subreddit, possibly rivaled by Lagavulin 16 (wait, do we not like that now? Keeping up with the meta is time-consuming).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n \\n**Nose:** Hot spice and rich sherry scents. I honestly find the nose to be the most impressive feature of A'bunadh; I breathe in deep notes of old wood, chocolate, and dried fruit. The beauty of it truly comes in with the spice that tops it off.\\n \\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Palate:** Bold flavors: wood, sherry, spice and fruit. With a dash of water the spice turns to syrupy goodness. Cons, if any? The youth comes across a bit by way of slightly overbearing wood flavors.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n \\n**Finish:** My least favorite aspect of A'bunadh - the finish is surprisingly unsatisfying **relative** to the nose and palate. Wood, sherry, and spice notes fade quickly into a dry heat in the back of my throat.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n \\nNobody has ever said this before: A'bunadh offers great quality/price. I prefer my sherry bombs to be a bit older and wiser, but A'bunadh brings all of the important flavors with a punch. It is definitely my go-to affordable (more or less) cask strength sherry bomb.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n \\n**Rating: 86/100**\",\n",
       " \"As many of you know, I live in the Great White Land-of-Provincial-Liquor-Regulation, and our prices for whisky suck. See, the government had this whole prohibition idea, and then when it ended, they decided they still needed to babysit us and ensure we didn't drink too much. Thus was born the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which today has morphed into a retailing giant that spends a ton of money on advertising to increase demand for alcoholic beverages, while maintaining a pricing strategy rooted in deterring demand for alcoholic beverages...also, they're terrible at both. Why do I rant about this in a whisky review? because today I'm reviewing one of the few bottles that is actually priced reasonably in this province!  Aberlour A'bunadh is a sherry-bomb-lovers-wet-dream, and I have the great fortune of reviewing 3 batches side by side today. I bought a bottle a long time ago, and happened to end up with batch 46. A huge thanks to /u/boyd86 for batch 53, which i swapped for back in November 2016, and to /u/slackerdude for the swap of batch#6 that I swapped for in March 2016. No, that wasn't a typo, the slacker came across it randomly on a shelf one day and it was an obvious insta-buy. Apparently someone must have had it on a shelf, saw how it had appreciated in price since it was launched back in 1999. crazy. anyway, on to the cask strength three-way! I'm going to review each element side by side, rather than going one dram at a time. I'll also lay it out in table format rather than bullet points for easy comparison across batches. \\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh | Batch #6 | Batch #46 | Batch #53\\n--------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------\\n**Appearance** | deep reddish orange with fat sexy legs | similar to #6 but slightly less red. | lighter still, but still a pink-orange hue. The legs on this one are incredible.\\n**Nose** | rich fruity nose, lots of berries, cherries, demerara sugar, caramel, red licorice, spices  | quite different than batch 6. much less fruit but somehow more sugary and a lot more oak influence. raspberry, caramel, vanilla, molasses. Less spicy than 6 | sweeter yet than the other two, and a bit more cloying. Not as much spice either.\\n**Palate** | a lot more woodiness than I expected to get. Quite dry, almost tannic, tart, nutty, with a ton of dark dried fruit. Raisins, figs, caramel, molasses. Delicious. A dry sherry bomb. strawberry, chocolate on those strawberries. More oak tannins, dry nutty goodness. wow | much sweeter than batch 6. way more sugary fruit, berries, chocolate,  tons of spice like cinnamon and nutmeg. Tastes much more youthful too and runs quite a bit hotter than the older batch.  | very different once again. Doesn't run nearly as hot as batch 46. has more of the nuttiness I expect from oloroso sherry, and it's super dry once again… dries out the mouth like a nice dry wine. Earthy, chocolate, light spiciness, red fruit, caramel, toffee, molasses. \\n**Finish** | long, dry, fruity and not overly sweet.  | medium, hot, spicy, sweet, and slightly bitter | longer than 46. dry, nutty, fruity. \\n**Overall** | This strikes a fantastic balance of some sweetness with a dry tannic character. Tons of flavour and each element shines through without over-powering the others.  | this batch isn't nearly as balanced as #6, and the cloying sweetness overpowers much of the other notes and it runs so hot I feel it needs water, unlike the other two. I previously rated this an 89, but that will be going down now that I've compared to its brethren. | batch 53 thankfully is better than 46 and gets back to the more balanced approach of batch 6. it has some sweetness, along wth a good punch of wood and dry tannic character. I'm having a hard time choosing which I like better, 6 or 53. \\n**Score** | 91 | 84 | 90\\n\\nin the end, I'm choosing batch 6 as my favourite. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and tend to love dry sherried malts, particularly a well done oloroso cask. This one just balances it all beautifully. The 46 is just way too sweet for me to score it as high as I did the first time... maybe my tastes have changed or something. The 53 is delicious and dry, but runs slightly hotter and isn't quite as balanced as 6.  Overall, such an awesome experience seeing the variations between batches. I WANT MORE!\\n\\n[Here is the review on my group's website](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/2017/01/24/aberlour-abunadh-three-way-review-batches-6-46-53/)\",\n",
       " \"From the website: With each batch specially crafted, Aberlour A’bunadh is a unique cask strength whisky that has achieved cult status among whisky connoisseurs. Meaning ‘the original’ in Gaelic, A’bunadh is made in homage to Aberlour’s founder, James Fleming, using only traditional methods without chill filtration or other modern processes. The result is a heavier, creamier single malt than most have ever experienced – memorably flavoursome, with an intense raisin character. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nColor: Dark amber with a reddish hue \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nNose: Intense alcohol, red wine (Syrah or some other spicy red). After addition of water: plum, raspberry, blackberry, aromatic spice, old books, chocolate \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nTaste: Red licorice, raspberry, blackberry, lemonade, chokecherry, molasses, nutmeg, apricot fruit leather, cola, chocolate \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFinish: Fruity, sweet and sour, minty \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nConclusion: At original cask strength the alcohol overpowers both my nose and palate, I've never had sherry (I'll have to rectify that since I really enjoy sherry cask finishes) but I get some strong full body wine nose and taste. I have to add some water to get the abv down closer to 50% before I can get to tasting and smelling the plethora of other flavors. I really enjoy the red and dark fruit along with the cola and chocolate flavors, kind of like a fudgy cherry coke. I can't remember what batch my last bottle was (forty something?), it was before I started to keep notes but this stuff is better I think.  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRating: A \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nA+:  Perfection, how do I replace my blood with this! (95-100/100) \\n\\n\\nA: Damn good, would love to always keep a bottle of this laying around at all times if I could afford to. (90-95/100) \\n\\n\\nB: I like it, would buy the occasional bottle, or order the occasional glass, but there are others I prefer more. (80-89/100) \\n\\n\\nC: Unremarkable but drinkable.

       " \"This is sample of batch 54 of Aberlour A'Bunadh, provided by /u/bieliebielie. This is the first of the 50's that I've tried, having had maybe 8 or 9 different batches in the 30's & 40's range in the past. I've found them to be pretty consistent quality wise, though the last bottle I bought was in 2014 so I've not really been keeping up. \\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:** Raisins & figs, a little toffee. There's a savoury earthy note too, a chalky dirtiness to it. some nail varnish remover. With a little water the sweetness is knocked off and leather & tobacco come out. A little nutty. Less sulphur / struck match than the last batch I had.      \\n\\n**Palate:** Big sweetness sugary dried fruit & orange. Spicy oak. Quite hot at full strength. With water the sweetness is still there but the heat is gone and oak turns to clove & black pepper. Unlit Cigar.      \\n\\n**Finish:** Long, spicy & chocolatey.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Comments:* Still very good whisky in my opinion, I'll happily continue recommend A'Bunadh to anyone looking to move on from basic OB offerings.     \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**86/100**\",\n",
       " '**Disclaimer**: These tastings were done in quick succession over the course of about 2 hours, so I’m sorry the notes aren’t that detailed.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**The Glenlivet Founders Reserve 1824** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 40% ABV, NAS*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $58  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries from their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -1  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Raisins, soft fruit, definite European oak influence, Belgian waffles, pancake syrup (not real maple). Adding water leads to notes of honey, hazelnuts and pralines.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Barley malt, sugar cookies, raisins, spices—nutmeg, vanilla, cloves. The addition of water reveals notes of honey and green apple, and lessens the raisin/grape notes.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Hazelnuts, malt, grape must. It’s not a long finish and water doesn’t change it.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I don’t love the colour scheme, but it’s designed to make it stand out on a back bar or shelf, what with the powder blue label.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  It’s a decent beginner’s malt or simple dram to enjoy on ice in the summer. Not really my bag, but not bad. I prefer the 12-year-old. The brand rep mentioned that some of the flavours in this indicate that it must be 7.5 years of age on average, but… yeah. I’d take that with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\\n**72/100**.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**The Glenlivet 15 – French Oak Reserve** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 40% ABV, 15 Years Old*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $88  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +1  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Spice melange, oak, orange oil, resin, thyme, maple syrup, plenty of rich, sweet fruitiness as well.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Very nice mouthfeel, soft and sweet with spiced honey, hazelnuts, pralines, orange oil, toffee & some strong oak tannins and influence.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sweet, spiced honey, hazelnuts, cedar, resin, caramel, and oak. Medium length, quite pleasant.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I’ll be honest enough to say I don’t love the packaging of The Glenlivet lineup. This one isn’t bad, but it doesn’t strike my fancy either.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Much more to my palate than the 1824 Founders Reserve. Excellent winter dram if you’re not craving smokiness or peat influence.  \\n\\n\\n**81/100**.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**The Glenlivet 18 (re-review)** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 43% ABV, 18 Years Old*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $150  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +2  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Oloroso sherry influence makes itself immediately known—nuttiness, syrupiness, oak-derived smokiness, warming spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and walnuts.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Nutty, thick mouthfeel, slight smokiness from the oak, plenty of tannins and spice. The honey from the younger entrants in the lineup has matured into something more like toffee or molasses.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Smoke, oak, nutmeg, raisins, spices intermingle with wood influence. It’s long, it’s pleasant, it’s warming. Great for cold weather.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is where their packaging starts to look a bit more appealing to me. Maybe that’s just because I know there’s quality whisky within.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  A more serious and challenging version of the 15. I’m not sure if the full-sized bottle just tastes better, but this one scores higher than the sample-sized bottle I tried a year ago. Maybe it’s had more time to breathe.  \\n\\n\\n**85/100**.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**The Glenlivet Nadurra First Fill Selection** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 60.4% ABV, NCF, NAS*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $103  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -3  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Sweet, unctuous, green apple, spiced honey, lemon, plenty of ethanol.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Sour apple, sweet honey, heather, white pepper, cedar sawdust, vanilla, lime.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Honey, white pepper, apple, bourbon cask influence exerts itself with a smoke/honey flavour and vanilla. Long finish.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  Definitely seems like natural colour. I quite like the Nadurra label actually.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Lovely stuff! Great summer dram. It’s wonderful that they bottle this stuff at such a high strength, seeing as they don’t sell much to independent bottlers.

This reminds me of a souped-up Chivas.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  It’s a wee squat li’l bottle with a large cork. I don’t love it. I feel like I’m being overly harsh on packaging today.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Lovely malt and a wonderful intro to ex-sherry/European oak cask influence. Oddly chocolatey. Reminds me of Chivas Regal, but minus the … blendy bits. I do like it.  (This is actually the second time I’ve had this whisky, each of which were at tastings or events. This time I had a chance to write down some notes and actually enjoy it a bit.)\\n\\n\\n**83/100**.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 54** (*Single Malt, Speyside, 60.7% ABV, NCF, NAS*)  \\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $135  \\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +3  \\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  Smoked chocolate, salted caramel, grape must, cedar, sawdust, barley syrup, red Chateauneuf-du-Pape.  \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Super spiced, very grapey—grape influence for days. Smoke, chocolate, salted caramel, sweet green tea/matcha, oak tannins and resin.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sweet caramel, smoke, chocolate, spices, oak fibres, fresh ream of printer paper, sawdust.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I like the labels from batch 20-30 more.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Wonderful stuff, plenty of cask influence, though I get more red wine than sherry. Would gladly receive a bottle of this as a gift, but I’m not sure I’d buy it.

Grape must, stems, vegetal and earthy. Plastic bucket, oak tannins and spices, sawdust and honey. Very strange.  \\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Honey, oak tannins, spice, grape stems and pomace brandy. Floral notes of lavender and heather appear after a while as well. Medium length.  \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  I like the boat, I don’t mind the label, the box is quite pretty. I like it.  \\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  A middle-of-the-road mouthfeel, but very interesting flavour. Very Pernod Ricard/Chivas. Fits their house style well, but different enough to stand out from the rest of their lineup. Pomace notes are lovely, and somehow work with the plastic-y/bucket-y flavours. Opens up and gets very sweet with time, with some of the vegetal notes dying down after a while. I like it.  \\n\\n\\n**84/100**.',\n",

       " \"**Review #384: Aberlour A’Bunadh Batch 54**\\n\\nAberlour A'bunadh was one of the first cask strength whiskies I've ever reviewed so it's strange that when I decided to try A'bunadh again it coincidentally came from the same batch that I tried all the way back 2 years ago, batch #54. Aberlour was one of the first distilleries that I bought a bottle from, that being the simple yet decent for the price Aberlour 12 Year Old, and while A'bunadh was one of my first drams I've tried I never really took a chance to try any others. Since I first tried a batch of A'bunadh everyone around me has basically told me about how downhill Aberlour has gone with the series, accompanied by major price increases in the USA and UK. So now the question remains: how does current me feel about this batch of A'bunadh in the face of increasing prices?

The sulphur is a little much at the beginning but it eases off with a bit of water. There’s some nice mixes of salt, red fruits, sweet barley and nuttiness that makes it a good experience but it’s just too simple for what I enjoy from a sherried whisky as well as too young. There should be enough here to say that this is a good whisky but the sulphur and raw young qualities just take too much away from making this a standout malt.\\n\\n**68/100**\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n*Current Scoring System Layout:*\\n\\n*0-29: Undrinkable*\\n\\n*30-49: Bad*\\n\\n*50-59: Mediocre*\\n\\n*60-69: Fair*\\n\\n*70-74: Good*\\n\\n*75-79: Very Good*\\n\\n*80-84: Great*\\n\\n*85-89: Excellent*\\n\\n*90-94: Magnificent*\\n\\n*95+: Masterpiece*\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n*/r/scotch Review Average=81.87*\",\n",

Lots of sweet cereal, but fruity, like Captain Crunch crunch berry if it was organic and less artificial. There's some definite wood spice here as well, and tannin.

       " '**Scotch Whisky Review #176: A \"Fragile\" Mystery Part 2**\\n\\nMuch like the [mystery review](https://scotchandsheen.com/2020/04/24/deanston-20-year-oloroso-sherry/) from yesterday, no information was provided about this whisky, just a bottle with a fragile sticker on it. Not a whole lot to say so let\\'s just jump on in!\\n\\n**Color:** [1.6, Mahogany/Henna Notes](https://i.imgur.com/CIl8iNs.jpg). Natural Color and Non-Chill Filtered. \\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Nose: (according to the wife)** It\\'s super peppery and really spicy. It\\'s like shoving your nose into a bag of chili powder (she specifically said 고춧가루 or Korea chili powder). There\\'s a bit of caramel that sneaks in behind the spiciness. Some dark red boozy fruit comes along as well, almost like the fruits you use for sangria. There\\'s a bit of clove as well.\\n\\n**Palate:** It\\'s a lot sweeter than I expected but it is still pretty spicy. The sweetness is a bit gritty and makes me think of sugarcane and rum. Then there is the heat. It starts off with just a tinge of heat but quickly explodes into a tongue numbing sensation, it actually reminded me a lot of Szechuan food and that gradual mouth numbing sensation that comes from Szechuan peppercorns. With a bit of water, it stays sweet with a bit of bitterness coming out. There\\'s some burn sugar and caramel joining the sugarcane notes. The spice level drops but it still pretty mouth numbing. With a lot more water, the rum like notes take full control. There\\'s a bit of marzipan, overripe banana, and a bit of aged oak. The spice is gone but that also might be because my tongue is just completely numb by this point.\\n\\n**Finish:** Fairly short. The rum/sugarcane notes are here for a bit before it evaporates.\\n\\n**Guess:** Something young aged in ex-rum casks. There isn\\'t a whole lot of options for ex-rum whisky and this doesn\\'t taste like anything made in Islay, the Islands, or Campbeltown so I\\'m going to have to guess its from a Speyside distillery. Young, ex-rum, Speyside...maybe it\\'s the Glenfiddich Fire & Cane? \\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Reveal:** >!Aberlour A\\'Bunadh Batch 55!<\\n\\n**Distillery:** >!Aberlour!<\\n\\n**Region:** >!Speyside!<\\n\\n**Cask Type:** >!Oloroso Sherry!<\\n\\n**ABV:** >!60.9%! Cask Strength!<\\n\\n**Age:** >!NAS!<\\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I drink a lot of sherried whisky and man, this one surprised me when I pulled back the fragile sticker. I was absolutely certain that it was matured in ex-rum casks! I\\'m still not sure where any of the sherry is in this but the 60.9% ABV really explains all of the tongue numbing spice. The sugar notes are really nice throughout the whisky and actually played very well with the level of spice. That little bit of overripe banana and marzipan helped balance things out a little bit as well. Pretty good overall, though you definitely want to dilute this down a bit while you drink it. Would I buy a bottle? I\\'ve been on the hunt for a Batch 64 actually having heard so many good things about it.\\n\\n**Final Score:** 81.\\n\\n*Scotch Whisky Review #176, Speyside Whisky Review #72, Whisky Network Review #242*\\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Scoring Legend:**\\n\\n* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods.\\n\\n* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky.\\n\\n* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible).\\n\\n* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here.\\n\\n* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink.\\n\\n* 70-74: Solid, wouldn\\'t go out of my way to get it.\\n\\n* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable.\\n\\n* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.\\n\\n\\n***********\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of my whisky reviews and reviews of whatever else I think of can be found over on my [blog]( https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/).\\n\\nTo view by rating grouping:\\n\\n* [Rated 96-100](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-96-100/)\\n* [Rated 90-95](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-90-95/)\\n* [Rated 85-89](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-85-89/)\\n* [Rated 80-84](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-80-84/)\\n* [Rated 75-79](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-75-79/)\\n* [Rated 70-74](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-70-74/)\\n* [Rated 60-69](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-60-69/)\\n* [Rated Below 59](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-below-59/)',\n",
       " \"Hello Scotchit! Todays review will be that of everyone's favourite sherry bomb, **Aberlour A'bunadh**. I've only had one other batch before and I remember it was stunning at the time (Batch #47). That was the whisky that got me into the world of cask strength whiskies and the rest is history. So, that was some time ago. Let's see if Batch #57 can wow me, as I've heard of a decline in quality with mid-50's batches. Shorter maturation, refill butts etc.. \\nI was curious and at the same time afraid, so here we go. \\n  \\n\\n**Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #57**\\n\\n\\nPrice paid/source: 60,50 EU / 70cl bottle\\n\\nRegion: Highlands \\n\\nAge: NAS\\n\\nBottling date: 2016\\n\\nCask type: Oloroso Butts\\n\\nAlcohol: 60,7% - 121,4 proof\\n\\nChill filtered: No\\n\\nColoured: No\\n\\nDrank: Neat in a Glencairn\\n \\n \\n* **Nose**: Immediately heavy on alcohol, dry sherry and ripe fruits. A malty character shows itself after a few sniffs. Butterscotch, brown sugar, dried apricot, pineapple, blood orange, \\nfruitcake, grapefruit, walnut, faint balsamic vinegar, leather, candied apple, capuccino, marzipan, chocolate, raisin, sultana, cloves, sour milk, spearmint, vanilla and ginger. Overall very dry, but quite sweet too. It has that classic bombastic sherry nose, but it has a little sharpness and doesn't feel as 'thick' as with older sherrybombs.    \\n* **Palate**: Mouth coating sherried goodness, but it feels a bit thin too. Dry sherry, vanilla, bitter orange, honey, rum soaked raisins, apple juice, dark chocolate, licorice, almonds, caramel sauce and sultana's.\\nA bit too spicy for me, unfortunately. I don't think water would harm this one as it has a bit of a rough edge.\\n* **Finish**: Medium, a little salty with dried fruits and malt.\\n\\n\\n**Thoughts**\\nYou just cannot hate this as a lover of sherried whisky and it's no wonder the A'bunadh pops to mind when someone is looking for a decent sherrybomb. This has to be the best bang for your buck \\nwhen it comes to that. It's a few years apart so I can't really compare as I've had quite a few whiskies inbetween, but I think Batch #47 was better. The nose on this one is fantastic though, but the palate has that sharp alcoholic edge found in many young whiskies. Adding water doesn't get rid of that flavour unfortunately.   \\nOverall a good one with not many flaws, but I hope they'll throw in some older stuff in the newer batches.\\nNot a whisky I would want on my shelf all the time, but I'm sure I'll occasionally buy some just to see if they improve :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> **84/100**\\n\\n\\n**Scoring chart** \\n\\n99-100 - Speechless. Nectar of the Gods\\n\\n95-98 - Unbelievable, the reason why I'm into whisky\\n\\n90-94 - Excellent stuff, a rare treat\\n\\n85-89 - Very good, would most likely return to my shelf\\n\\n80-84 - Good, better than most whiskies out there\\n\\n75-79 - Decent, enjoyable but forgettable\\n\\n70-74 - Okay, a few flaws here and there\\n\\n65-69 - Subpar, would not recommend\\n\\n60-64 - Seriously flawed, hardly enjoyable neat \\n\\n50-59 - Bad, would only use as mixer material \\n\\n0-50 - Very bad, nauseating, vomit-inducing and everything inbetween\",\n",
       " 'Aberlour’s very popular (in whisky circles, at least) NAS cask strength sherry bomb. Aged entirely in Spanish oloroso sherry casks. I was never quite sure, but after a little Googling, I found that means that the actual oak is Spanish. Which, is not the oak that sherry producers actually use; they prefer American oak. Interesting tidbit.\\n\\nSo this is the 57th batch of A’bunadh. 60.7% abv. NCA, NCF. \\n\\n**Nose** - Fresh strawberries, super buttery, brown sugar, gummy bears. Something a little herbaceous and bitter, like the stem of a strawberry. Maple syrup. A single raisin. I did decide to add some water here, wondering if knocking down the heat a bit would up the complexity a bit. That added a really strong cherry note, apricot, vanilla.  \\n\\n**Palate** - A blast of pure sherry, then it settles down and you can make out the notes a little easier. Baking spices, brown sugar, figs, wood varnish, strawberries. Raisins. Cherry gummy candies. A slight nutty note, like almonds. A hint of citrus peel. Thick mouthfeel. Water: Just turned down the heat a bit. Maybe helped the cherry note that was already there, and added a bit of prune. Mouthfeel was unharmed. \\n\\n**Finish** - A burst of raspberry, tobacco, and tea right on swallowing. Sweet. Honey, wood, berries. Long, the honey turns to maple syrup as it goes on. An herbal element comes in. The water sort of turned down the tannin-y raspberry and stuff that came at the beginning, sadly. Wood came out a little stronger throughout, and a nice chocolate covered orange note came in. Cherry too. Maybe there’s essence of cherry in my water, because that note came out a lot stronger with the addition. \\n\\n**Overall** - 6/10. Delicious, brash, uncomplex. Really powerful, but sometimes it is just beating you over the head. Luckily, this is one of those times were the sherry just works for me. A little dash of water did slightly change the profile, but not enough to affect my rating either way. \\n\\nI found that I enjoy this more the less I dissect it. It’s not that this is a mindless drinker; it’s way too strong for that. But there is a certain sense of cohesion that gets lost the more you try to pull notes apart. Maybe I start to notice how hot it is, and that the notes are a little shallow. All I know is that when I am just sipping on this and browsing the internet, I enjoy it more than when I sit down to and review it. I don’t know if that makes any sense. But there it is.\\n\\n**Grading Scale**\\n\\n10 - Rock. Solid.\\n\\n9 - Amazing. An all time favorite, characterful, hits me just right.\\n\\n8 - Great. The flaws here are more nitpicks than anything.\\n\\n7 - Good. Recommend this to family, friends, and whisky/spirit geeks.\\n\\n6 - Above average. Reaching territory I’m likely to buy a bottle at.\\n\\n5 - Average. Boring OR interesting enough to make up for a couple things wrong\\n\\n4 - Below average. Extremely boring, or too many off notes.\\n\\n3 - Needs improvement. Might be some good or interesting things here, but mostly bad.\\n\\n2 - Bad. Extremely flawed. Likely a drain pour as well.\\n\\n1 - Garbage. Drain pour after a sip or two.\\n',\n",

Molasses and chocolate. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Palate:** Full-bodied is an understatement. Has an Incredible, rich, oily mouthfeel. Hot – very hot. It explodes through the mouth with sherry, raisins, dried fruits, spiced currants, dark chocolate, and (some, but not lots of) oak. Walnuts on a ***VERY*** boozy Christmas cake.

Hints of oak\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Comments:** So much sherry! This is one of those whiskies that is at its best on the first taste. Even with water this can easily overpower your senses (the alcohol completely nukes your tongue, for example). It’s not at all prickly though but I’d definitely recommend tasting this one with added water to protect your tongue.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI’ll be honest, as much as I enjoy Aberlour A’bunadh as a sherry-bomb, I’d prefer this whisky to have a little more time in the cask. A 12-15yo age statement could take this from the high end of the “Very Good” category (i.e. buy on a good deal) to mid-“Excellent” tier. Extra cask influences on this particular batch, to round it off, would do it a world of good. Please Aberlour, give us a cask-strength age-statement whisky! As such, I won’t be actively seeking out another bottle of this (unless a future A’bunadh batch goes on sale for a similar price), but it’s definitely a very good whisky, and a great sherry-tactical-nuke. A definite must-buy for sherried-whisky lovers!

I like the color.\\n\\n* **Nose:** The pure nose leaves me perplexed at first: This is clearly raspberry juice. What the heck is that? (I mean: I like raspberries, but it's a bit unexpected now.) Behind that, lemon and wood. Mmmh, wood! Another try: I smell cream pie. It can't be my hunger, I had some food before. Some alcohol rises, which is now stronger and temporarily dominates, then also here some menthol freshness, then a fruit, where I actually had to read further up, because I did not think of the word: figs. (I don't drink enough bad booze, contrary to popular belief, I'm afraid.) Quite a lot going on in the nose here, I like it. Water accentuates the barrel more and naturally diminishes the alcohol cloud.\\n* **Taste:** On the tongue it continues seamlessly with the figs, though also carried by a stronger alcohol note; then Donauwelle, from which the cherries emerge, which turn out to be the artificially sweet canned cocktail cherries from the discount store. Unfortunately, I have to swallow too quickly because my mouth is too full, but just in time I taste marzipan potatoes and some gingerbread. With water, the cherries turn into rum cherries. You'd almost think there was alcohol involved here.\\n* **Finish:** Not much flavor to be found in the astringent finish other than barrel spice.\\n* **Verdict:** 90/100, including bonus points for the very affordable price.

Natural colour, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Price Paid:** $100 CAD for 750 mL in Ontario. \\n\\n**Barrels:** Batch 59 is, as usual, aged in Oloroso sherry barrels.\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, then with several drops of water, in a large copita. Sampled at my local liquor monopoly’s tasting bar. Rested 10 or so minutes.\\n\\n**Colour:** Burnished copper. \\n\\n**Nose:** Some alcohol nip at first, but once that fades, I was greeted by big, spicy honey and deep fruit. The Oloroso [attacks you]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U90dnUbZMmM) with raisin, black cherry, and dates. There’s a nice sweet buttery note in there. Lots of cinnamon, spiced orange, brown sugar, vanilla and dark chocolate.\\n\\nSeveral drops of water later, banana appears. More sherry and cinnamon, and a nice raspberry note.\\n\\n**Palate:** Tastes HOT. Like fireworks in your mouth. Big red grape and raisin, followed by a huge swell of hot cinnamon and brown sugar. Like Bunnahabhain dialed to 11. Almost a chipotle pepper kind of woody, fruity spice towards the end. Quite a bit of earthy dark chocolate. The sherry bends into banana and dates after several seconds. \\n\\nThe water greatly tones down the alcohol, but the big flavour is retained. \\n\\n**Finish:** Long and sweet. My mouth stayed hot for a good while afterwards. Dark chocolate persists, but is joined by a nice milk chocolate note. Somewhat earthy.\\n\\n**Notes:** Big, big, big flavor. Makes my Bunnahabhain 12 seem downright tame in comparison. Incredible value for the price if you’re looking for a sherry bomb. I think this batch might be better than another I had a while ago, but I honestly have no idea.\\n\\n**Final score: 80/100**\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.\\n\\n60-69: Not really for me, but I wouldn't turn down a glass.\\n\\n70-74: Sorta average. Definitely drinkable, but you can do better. \\n\\n75-79: A tasty dram worth trying at the very least.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good. Well above average.\\n\\n85-89: Truly excellent, a standout malt.\\n\\n90-94: Personal favourite.\\n\\n95-100: Mythical.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I've reviewed a bunch of batches of A'bunadh in the past and have noticed a downward trend.  I found [this blog post](https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/2015/12/07/aberlour-abunadh-batch-49/) awhile back and decided I needed to try batch 49.  I won a bottle at auction for not much more than retail.  And it arrived at around the same time as I got a sample of batch 60 from an [online retailer](www.whiskysite.nl).  I had a bit of my batch 61 left to compare against, which is my least favorite batch so far.  So hopefully they are both better than that.  Batch 49 ABV = 60.1% and Batch 60 ABV = 60.3%.  Batch 49 is a shade or two darker than batch 60.  Non chill-filtered and no added color.\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Nose:**  Rich, sweet, earthy, and nutty.  Brown sugar.  Almonds.  Marzipan.  Menthol.  Hazelnuts.  Cocoa.  Leather.\\n\\n**Batch 60 Nose:**  Sweet, clean, nutty.  Ethanol heat.  Sugar syrup.  Apples.  Caramel.  Pine sap.  Pinesol.  Younger, hotter, and less rich on the nose than batch 49.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Palate:**  Rich, thick, creamy mouthfeel.  Turbinado sugar.  Earth.  Leather.  Caramel.  Toffee.  Almonds.  Nutella.  Earth.  \\n\\n**Batch 60 Palate:**  Rich, thick, syrupy mouthfeel.  Sweeter.  Sugar syrup.  Ethanol heat.  Chocolate.  Toffee.  Almond bark.  Adding a few drops of water really helps the palate on this.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Finish:**  Medium long finish.  Earthy and rich.  Still an underlying caramelized sugar.  But all about the leather and earth and nuts.  Subtle black pepper.  A bit of old oak spice.\\n\\n**Batch 60 Finish:**  Medium long finish.  The sweetness carries through.  Here we get more earth.  Leather.  Black pepper.  Subtle nuttiness.  A bit bitter.\\n\\n\\n**Batch 49 Score:** 91/100\\n\\n**Batch 60 Score:** 88/100\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis was super fun.  I think that batch 49 is indeed the best I've had so far.  Absolutely delicious.  It has everything that makes A'bunadh my favorite sherry bomb - the richness, the nuttiness, the earthiness, without tasting too young or sweet.  That said, batch 60 was actually very good as well.  Better than the batch 61 that I had a bottle of, that's for sure.  It tastes younger for sure.  And sweeter.  But less complex and less nutty and earthy.  Batch 61 seems even hotter and younger than 60 to me.  All of them are slightly improved with a few drops of water, as well.\\n\\nSo overall, I really think that 40s > 50s > 60s, at least for my palate.  One of these days I'm gonna have to splurge on some earlier 20s and 30s batches.  Batch 60 and 61 and quite a bit sweeter, and I know plenty of people get their kicks from sweet as hell sherry bombs.  So these may be better for you.  But for me tastes, I love the nutty earthy 40s batches.  And I'll do my best to buy a few more while I can.\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'Aberlour'\",\n",

       " \"Another new batch of A'Bunadh.  And after finding the quality to decline from the 40s to the later 50s batches, I've heard a few good things about the new 60+ batches.  Let's see if the hype is real, as this used to be my favorite not too sweet sherry bomb.  Batch 61 is matured exclusively in Oloroso sherry butts as usual and bottled at cask strength, 60.8% ABV.  No added color and non chill-filtered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Nose:**  Gentler nose than other batches.  Almonds.  Sea salt.  Caramel.  Nuts.  Leather.

Somewhat bitter.  Lots of pepper.  After some water, lots of leather comes out.  And less roughness.  But still quite sweet.\\n\\n**Score:** 86/100\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThis is an interesting dram.  Its far sweeter and bigger then any other batch of A'Bunadh I've had.  More like a Glendronach single cask.  And for lots of people that would be a good thing.  But not for my palate.  I prefer the older batches.  They were much more interesting, nutty, leathery, and complex.  I'm guessing they contained more older casks in them.  This is probably comprised of younger very active sherry casks.  It is smoother than the last batch I tried at least.  And I'll enjoy this when I'm in the mood for a sherried sweetie.  But from now on, I think I'll avoid A'Bunadh unless I find an older batch for sale.\\n\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'Aberlour'\",\n",
       " '\\n**Introductory Comments**:  I recently [reviewed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/854i1g/reviews_6_7_8_macallan_classic_cut_tamdhu_batch/) three NAS sherry bombs that are easy to find and not terribly expensive, but I had been eagerly waiting for the Aberlour A\\'bunadh to go on sale at my local store because no survey of this style is complete without tasting the A\\'bunadh, the reputation of which /u/Pork_Bastard eloquently [characterized] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/6c86r7/reviews_101_102_aberlour_abunadh_vs_glendronach/),\\n\\n> everyone seems to praise abunadh as the king daddy of NAS sherry bombs under a bill.\\n\\nThat being said, the A\\'bunadh has suffered in recent years from the perception of a decline in quality, which is something many NAS, high-proof malts struggle with (see e.g. the Uigeadail).  /u/The-Foo recently [discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/7yagkg/the_glenlivet_nadurra_16/) this topic:\\n\\n> Oh man, I\\'m hardly a subject matter authority on A\\'bunadh (especially more recent batches). That said, 52 wasn\\'t bad, but if you can find examples back in the 40\\'s (45, 43, 42, 40 were all really good) it was a sweeter and \"creamier\" whisky back in those batches (and the further back you go, the better it gets). That said, I still haven\\'t spent any time with the batch 61 I have, though I hear it\\'s a step above the later 50\\'s batches (of which I really didn\\'t like 58).\\n\\nHis thoughts seem to capture the general consensus I\\'ve noticed about the A\\'bunadh:  Used to be great, the batches in the late 40s and the 50s weren\\'t as great, but it may be improving with the most recent batches.  So I was happy to pick up a bottle of batch 61 for myself to see how I like it.  I\\'ve never had a taste of the A\\'bunadh before, but I have had a number of NAS sherry bombs currently on the market, so let\\'s see how it stacks up to its current competition, not its former self...\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Aberlour A\\'bunadh, Batch 61** (60.8% ABV, non-chillfiltered, natural color, NAS)\\n\\n* **Nose**:  Christmas spices, brown sugar, milk chocolate, caramel, figs, raisins, cherries, some leather, a bit of ginger, and some nuttiness.  It\\'s incredibly rich and decadent, and the intensity and variety of wonderful aromas is almost overwhelming.\\n* **Palate**:  Christmas spices, ginger, and dark cherries with a bit of sour oak; mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I would expect given the strength, but it\\'s still fairly heavy; some heat from the alcohol but not much burn at all\\n* **Finish**:  An initial wave of pleasantly warm, mildly spicy cinnamon gives way to candied nuts, citrus, and slightly bitter dark chocolate and tannic notes\\n\\n**Score**:  88/100\\n\\n**Comments**:  I don\\'t know how batch 61 stacks up to previous batches, but it certainly stands on its own as a delicious whisky.  But I\\'ve seen some of the criticisms of recent batches, and my sense is that this has to be an improvement.  NAS sherry bombs run into trouble when they are too young and the sherry cask dominates the spirit, a combination that can result in a whisky that is a hot, winey, overly-tannic mess.  Batch 61 does not suffer from these problems:  There is certainly some heat from the alcohol, but it\\'s very drinkable neat, and the bitterness isn\\'t too strong or off-putting, but rather it comes across as more of a pleasant mild dark chocolate kind of note. \\n\\nThis allows all of the other flavors -- and there are lots of them -- to stand out and be appreciated.  The breadth and depth of flavor is huge, ranging from spicy to fruity to rich and creamy to nutty.  And unlike the Macallan Classic Cut, which is more biased towards rich ginger and oak, or Tamdhu Batch Strength, which is more biased towards fruity sweetness, this A\\'bunadh batch 61 delivers a more balanced spectrum of flavors.\\n\\nNow on to a couple of criticisms of this whisky.  Firstly, I deducted some points because even though it satisfies on the palate and with the finish, the nose does write a massive check that isn\\'t quite cashed to its full potential.  The most enjoyable part of this whisky for me is nosing it after it\\'s been allowed to rest in the glass for a good 30 minutes.  The taste is great, but the nose is definitely the best part of the experience.\\n\\nSecondly, this whisky did lose a lot of its punch shortly after I opened the bottle.  During the first week, the aromas and flavors were incredibly strong, but the intensity definitely mellowed out after the first few drams.  This is unfortunate because the A\\'bunadh is no longer easy to find for \"under a bill\" these days.  Even though I preferred this to the Macallan Classic Cut, I actually found myself enjoying the Mac CC more and more as I progressed through the bottle, and where I live, I typically find the Mac CC priced cheaper than the A\\'bunadh.\\n\\nSo my overall assessment of batch 61 is:  If you can find it for $100 or less, pick it up and drink it quickly once you open it.  You\\'ll be hard-pressed to find a more satisfying high-proof sherry-matured whisky on the market right now at that price point.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Scoring Guide**\\n\\n**95-100**:  Transcendent; I need to bunker some bottles.\\n \\n**90-94**:  Excellent; I always want to have a bottle on my shelf.\\n\\n**85-89**:  Very good; I would happily buy another bottle at some point.\\n\\n**80-84**:  Good; I might buy this again if it\\'s a really good price.\\n\\n**75-79**:  Decent, but I\\'m not interested in buying again.\\n\\n**70-74**:  Mediocre; I\\'ll have a hard time finishing this bottle.\\n\\n**60-69**:  Bad enough that I regret buying this bottle.\\n\\n**0-59**:  Awful.',\n",

A bit more spice, too. \\n\\n**Taste:** dried dark fruits and sherry. A bit of ginger spiciness. Molasses. Toffee. Tobacco. Strong black tea. Chocolate. Earthy. Medium-thick mouthfeel.

Very nice.\\n\\n**Score:** 7\\n\\n**Summary:** this is a rich, dark sherry bomb. Tons of beautiful fruits covered in molasses. Some nice notes of tobacco, hay, damp earth, and even a bit mineral. Nutty, with a mild spice throughout. Mouthfeel is quite good, and the finish is excellent. Overall a great dram, and it works really well neat even at almost 60% ABV. A touch of water (really, just a few drops here) brings more fruit and spice, keeping the beautiful mouthfeel and finish.\\n\\nThis is not my typical flavor profile, and as such this bottle tends to sit on the shelf sad and alone. And that's a shame. I should drink it more often.\\n\\nAlso, I suspect my wife thinks I'm underrating this one. She keeps coming back and stealing the last bits of it.\\n\\n**Would I buy a bottle?** yup.

Medium length, though shorter than the 50 for sure. A bit hot. A little dry. **With Water:** less leather. More spice. Less heat. More nuts. Sadly shorter.\\n\\n**Score:** 6\\n\\n**Summary:** this is still a big sherry bomb, but it's a different character. (More below.) Lots of nice dark sweet fruits and leather, with some tobacco, vanilla, nuts, and caramel along for the ride. The nose is a bit shy, even with water, and sadly water thinned the mouthfeel out a bit. Water did bring it into better balance, though, and knocked back some of the leather and heat. Still much more leathery than the 50.\\n\\nI usually think of A'Bunadh as a prime example of a high-ABV dram that just doesn't need water. The 61 is letting me down on that a bit though. It's rather hot neat, and oddly balanced.\\n\\n**Would I buy a bottle?** hmm. I'd dig for an older batch honestly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison\\n\\n**Order:** 50 > 61\\n\\nThis is a really easy call. The 50 is big, rich, dark, thick, and just delicious. The 61 is softer, thinner, not as fruity, and much more leathery. A simpler flavor profile all around. More nutty, more vanilla and caramel. The 61 also feels hotter all around than the 50. I'd add water by default to the 61, but I'm happy to have the 50 neat.\\n\\nThis also used to be quite a bargain. I feel like the Batch 50 I have cost me around $70 or so in 2015. I see now it's going for $95 at my local Total Wine, and it's not clear which batch that is. I think I'd be fine with $95 for the 50 honestly.

       " \"**Review #28: Aberlour A'Bunadh Batch 62**\\n\\nIn Norway, it's illegal to sell alcohol above 60% ABV, so we rarely see most A'Bunadh batches around these parts.  It's been years since last time it was around, so when suddenly this 62nd batch at 59.9% ABV appeared on the shelves I snagged one despite its hefty pricetag of about €105.  I don't remember what batch # I had before, but I remember it was great.  That was a long time ago at a bar, so this is the first bottle I've owned.  Unchill-filtered and matured exclusively in Oloroso sherry butts for an undisclosed amount of time.\\n\\n**Nose**: Candied sweetness.  Vanilla, apricot, berries.

It's very obvious these are American oak casks (a quick search tells me Oloroso butts usually are) and there must be a lot of refill casks or the sherry seasoning was left in the cask for the bare minimum amount of time, because it has just as prominent Bourbon notes as it does sherry.  I personally prefer my sherried scotches with more age and/or more European oak – the sort of rich meaty, musty, leathery and/or sulphuric notes a great sherried scotch can have are all absent here.  Time has been good to it though, and the overwhelming sweetness has been tempered over the two or so months the bottle has been opened.  However, it's way overpriced for what you're getting.  In my market it is in a price tier above other NAS cask strength sherry bombs like Glengoyne Cask Strength and Glenfarclas 105.\\n\\n**Grade**: B-\",\n",

In terms of flavour it’s in line with the taste – fairly simple.\\n\\n**Overall:** My tasting notes are perhaps harsher than my actual view of this whisky.

       " \"The last time I tackled A’Bunadh, side-by-side reviewing [batches 44 and 53](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ddz6sh/bottle_review_2324_aberlour_abunadh_batches_44/) last year, I began thinking of Aberlour’s batch-released NAS sherry bomb as existing on a continuum between richly fruity, jammy and cinnamon-laced on one end, and woody, earthy, tannic and vanilla-forward on the other. I felt that it was not consistent enough from batch to batch to just drop around $100 on a bottle and take a chance, hoping for the former and ending up with the latter (at the time, batches 61-63 were out and none were getting great reviews.) However, A’Bunadh is also one of my partner’s favorite Scotches, and when I saw the wave of positive reviews for this newer batch, we decided to take another gamble on it.\\n\\nAs always, notes taken not necessarily at the same time, but experienced over the whole course of the bottle-- and from my stemmed tulip glass, a ¾-size Glencairn-on-a-stick.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Aberlour A’Bunadh, batch 64\\n\\n750mL bottle, bottled 2019, 59.9% ABV ~ $92 USD\\n\\nTime scale: open around eight weeks, tasting notes taken:\\n\\n* **just beneath the shoulder,**\\n\\n* beneath the ½ mark,\\n\\n* *and beneath the ¼ mark.*\\n\\nNose: **rich baking spices, dry leaves, red fruits in the background,** struck matches, *a touch of vanilla, forest floor, cherry cordials*\\n\\nPalate: **full body ~ warming sherry spices coat the tongue,** spicier heat, *well-integrated oak, some floral notes peeking out toward the heel*\\n\\nFinish: **long ~ the best five chews of a stick of cinnamon gum, subtle wood spice**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBottle thoughts: It’s simple, yes, but one buys A’Bunadh for intensity of flavor rather than complexity, and it certainly delivers on that. I have some mixed feelings about this batch: it does feature many of the same great elements I found in batch 53, and I can see how it generated hype, especially in the first half of the bottle or so. As it goes down, though, it does reveal slightly more of the ‘earthy’ side of the A’Bunadh spectrum, being less consistent over time than the other batches I've tried. This really became obvious when tasting it side-by-side with a sample of batch 53, which still comes across as jammy and cinnamon-forward-- batch 64 is just a tad more shy with those notes as time passes. It's still really tasty stuff, and for A'Bunadh fans I doubt it will disappoint. \\n\\n\\nScore: **8**\\n\\n\\n**10** ~ Outstanding, transcendent\\n\\n**9** ~ Excellent, complex, balanced and flavorful\\n\\n**8** ~ Great, eminently enjoyable\\n\\n**7** ~ Good and solid\\n\\n**6** ~ Decent, above average\\n\\n**5** ~ Average, uninspiring, drinkable\\n\\n**4** ~ Below average, not connecting\\n\\n**3** ~ Subpar, unpleasant\\n\\n**2** ~ Distasteful\\n\\n**1** ~ Impressively nasty\",\n",
       " \"After noticing and commenting on the declining quality of A'bunadh extensively, I bought another bottle.  haha.  So I was at a duty free and wanted something to drink while I'm away, and their selection was absolutely shite.  If I wanted something bottled at cask strength, it was either this or Glenlivet Nadura, so I chose this.  We'll see if it continues the decline of this once fine whisky.   Batch 64 was matured in sherry casks and bottled at cask strength, 59.9% ABV.  No added color and non-chill filtered.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:**  Beautiful sherried nose.  Chocolate.  Caramel.  Brown sugar.  Toffee.  Leather.  Earth.  Almonds.  Hazelnuts.  Burnt sugar.  A bit of grapefruit rind and lychee.  Subtle minerality.\\n\\n**Palate:**  Medium thick mouthfeel.  Somewhat hot straight off.  Toffee.  Caramel.  Butterscotch pudding.  Almonds.  Hazelnut chocolate spread.  Fudge.  Leather.  Slight earth.  A bit of sea salt.  A small splash of water takes most of the heat out and leaves the rest of the good things.  Less sweet after water though.  Lots of leather and earth and nuts.  Nutty with a bit of fudge.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Medium finish.  Sea salt.  Leather.  Bric-a-brac assortment of nuts.  Some tannins.  Oaky.  Cedar.  A bit of black pepper.  After water, the nuttiness lingers much more.  Almonds and even pistachios.\\n\\n\\n**Score:**  91\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nWell I'll be a god damned son of a bitch.  This is the best A'bunadh I've had in a long time!  I think its as good as the old batches from the 30s and 40s that I've tried.  The youth and overwhelming sweetness are gone.  I get a nuttier and earthier sherry bomb, though still with plenty of caramel and fudge.  I'm honestly very surprised at how much I like this and how good it is.  Now I need to give a qualifier - I haven't tried this side by side any of the other batches.  And while I've greatly enjoyed it the past couple nights, tastes can change.  It could just be that I was really in the mood for a cask strength sherry bomb.  But even if that is true, I still think this one is significantly above the quality of the last 5 or so batches.  My favorite since the 40s batches for sure.  Glad I picked this up!\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n/u/review_bot 'A'bunadh'\",\n",

There's a lot of sherry as well with note of aged oak, some brown sugar, and a touch of lychee. \\n\\n**Palate:** Oh it's a sherry bomb alright. Sherry permeates throughout the moment it touches the tongue with a touch of aged oak. The lychee note from the nose continues to show itself as well. Some ground pepper also makes and appearance. A tiny bit of water cools this down tremendously. It becomes quite creamy with a bit of water as well. Vanilla comes out to express itself as does butterscotch. It's almost like a butterbeer at this point. \\n\\n**Finish:** Before water is added, it's on the shorter side with a very dry finish. With a bit of water, the finish lingers much longer. Vanilla, cinnamon dust, orange bitters, and a bit of tannins pop up. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** While Aberlour's A'bunadh line can very heavily from batch to batch, I've heard nothing but great things about Batch #64 so I was very happy to find this on the shelf. It absolutely does not disappoint. The new marker smell is a bit strange but I imagine it'll dissipate as this has more time to oxidize (review was from the first pour from the bottle).

       " '**Aberlour A’bunadh Batch 65**\\n\\nHello all, please join me for my first ever cask strength Scotch tasting! Enter the Aberlour A’bunadh, a NAS Speyside single malt aged exclusively in Spanish Oloroso sherry butts. This particular richly colored, wax-laden bottle is part of Batch Number 65. Let’s dive right in, shall we?\\n\\n**ABV:** 59.5%\\n\\n**Cost:** $95 USD for 750mL bottle\\n\\n**Region/Type:** Speyside Single Malt\\n\\n**Chill-Filtration:** No\\n\\n**Color:** 1.5, auburn\\n\\n**Enjoyed:** Glencairn glass, neat\\n\\n**Nose:** Intense yet enjoyable whiffs of caramel, rum, oak, and leather. I feel like I’m on a pirate ship, Jack Sparrow aboard the Black Pearl. With water, I’m still getting rum, in addition to vanilla, banana, and other fruits.\\n\\n**Palate:** Very strong cinnamon, raisin, and bourbon notes, mixed with all sorts of spices. With water, the palate is less spicy, with fruits and dark chocolate emerging from the woodwork. \\n\\n**Finish:** Spices, dried fruit, long and bold finish. With water, milder but still laden with spice.\\n\\n**Rating:** 82/100 – wow, this bottle packs an absolute punch. The nose was extremely enjoyable, I think I could take whiffs of this forever. Very strong body with more heat than I’m used to, although it opens up to water quite well. After a couple drams of this my BAC is probably comparable to that of Jack Sparrow’s. Completely worth the money for any sherry lovers who want to bump their Speyside experience up a notch.',\n",
       " \"Giving this review thing a second shot (although still out of a tumbler, Glencairn is on the way)!\\n\\nSo first disclaimer: I'm bad at this but this is my second bottle of A'Bunadh and I've also had (sadly now deceased) The A'Bunadh Alba (which I loved but got removed from r/scotch because I didn't know the rules of posting whiskyporn)!\\n\\n**Nose** strong Sherry (capital S) and cream. It feels like you're at the obligatory fudge shop when you're on holidays, but dreams came true and someone said 'would you like the whisky fudge sir?'\\n\\n**Palate** ok so i've mentioned the cream, but it tastes thicker than I'm used to. It's gorgeous. The cask strength requires no water for me to enjoy this neat. I've seen some crazy descriptors on r/scotch but of all the things said about Aberlour in general can I mention the lingering taste of a cuban cigar without smoke? I'm also thinking chestnuts, but is it just because it's Christmas? Added disclaimer: only the conclusion of this review should be taken as gospel.\\n\\n**Conclusion** on a scale of (A) I'm glad to have tasted this but I would not hunt another one down to (B) I would certainly buy a second bottle and I'd like it to be around forever, I'm going for **B+** (I have a third bottle stashed away, when will this batch run out? Will more batches be produced?)\\n\\nFinal thoughts: this is an excellent Christmas Sherry treat, I'm so glad to have some.\",\n",
       " \"**Introduction:**  So for December my girlfriend and myself decided to put together our own whisky advent calendar using stuff from our shelf. The reason its labelled semi-blind is because while I didn't know what the dram is while tasting I do know what it *could* be since it came from our shelf.  Also I won’t be posting one every day as we didn’t have enough open bottles that I haven’t already reviewed recently. \\n\\nSo tonight we pulled the A'Bunadh! Admittedly this one wasn't as blind because I only have a couple cask strength sherry whiskies on the shelf so I had a pretty good idea which one it was.  I've seen some glowing reviews of this one, and while i did enjoy it I wasn't in love with it. A bit too hot even with water, but I enjoyed it because I can't pass up a sherry bomb. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n___\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Whisky:** Aberlour A'Bunadh\\n\\n**Country/Region:** Scotland/Speyside\\n\\n**ABV:** 61.5%\\n\\n**Age:** 5 year\\n\\n**Cask:** Oloroso\\n\\n**Chill Filtered?:** No\\n\\n**Color Added?:** No statement, but from some reading it sounds like no\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n___\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Tasted in a glencairn after resting for ~15 minutes*\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:** Red fruits, cherry, strawberry, vanilla \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Palate:**  Strong! Big fruit flavors with an almost syrupy texture. Definitely a sherry bomb at probably a high ABV. Lots of cherry, strawberry, and some watermelon. With water the heat is tamed down a bit turning from just a burn to a more enjoyable cinnamon spice, but the other flavors remain about the same. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Finish:**  Fades pretty quickly, from  the strong fruit sweetness into a more tame vanilla flavors with a slight hint of strawberry. \\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n___\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Overall Notes**: This one really explodes with flavor, it’s a bit one dimensional being just a huge sherry bomb. But luckily I love a nice sherry bomb! Even with water it’s pretty hot still, I kept adding more thought the tasting and it still stayed pretty spicy. I really enjoyed the texture of this one, coats the mouth with a great feel. \\n\\n&nbsp; \\n\\n**Score:** 78/100\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Post Reveal Reaction:** Yeah I had a feeling about this one. I only have so many cask strength sherry bombs on the shelf. I enjoy this one, although the sheer amount of heat does take away a bit from the dram. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Would I Buy A(nother) Bottle?** Lately I've seen this for $85 at the very cheapest.

       " '### Aberlour Casg Annamh Batch 0001\\nSince nobody\\'s done this one yet I figured it would be a good way to grab attention for my first review...  \\n\\nAccidentally named when Graeme Cruickshank cleared his throat in a marketing meeting, \"Casg Annamh\" is Gaelic for \"rare cask.\" A new entry in the Aberlour lineup, a sister series to the well-received A\\'bunadh, this NAS single malt is matured in a trio of cask types, including European oak sherry casks and two sorts of American oak cask. The packaging is reminiscient of it\\'s sister whisky, though it packs a little less punch, coming in at 48% ABV. \"Batch 0001\", the first release in the series (obviously), seems to indicate that Cruickshank plans to live long enough to release at least another 999 runs of this stuff - maybe the fountain of youth was under Ben Rinnes all along? Anyways, lets get down to the whisky itself.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Distiller:** Aberlour  \\n**Region:** Speyside  \\n**ABV:** 48%  \\n**Age:** NAS  \\n**Price:** £58.99 if you\\'re flying through Heathrow, or £108 if you\\'re me and got this off an auction site because you\\'re impatient and couldn\\'t wait for it to get to US markets.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in a glencairn  \\n\\n**Nose:** Aggressive nail polish remover right out of the gate, overwhelming most of the other notes. Given a little time to settle down the acetone almost vanished and I began to find notes of grape and apple juice, honey, and Aberlour\\'s dependably present hints of strawberry. After a while I came across more of the raisins and dark fruit I was expecting from the sherry cask influence.  \\n\\n**Palate:** Sweet from the get-go, with rich honey, graham crackers, and cinnamon. Occasional traces of mint (which I wrote down with a \\'?\\' next to it, so who knows) and chocolate with a soft background of raisins. The bottle itself talks about licorice, cloves, and ginger, but none of those are jumping out at me.  \\n\\n**Finish:** The raisins hold on the longest, with hints of spicy cinnamon and a slight bitterness. The smell of apple juice and proofed bread dough echoes in and out.  \\n\\n**Overall:** This is a wonderfully sweet and relaxed whisky, compared to the noisy, punchy A\\'bunadh. There\\'s still a good nip of spice but it comes in like a hearth fire, not all crashing cymbals and blasting trumpets like its sister. It took water pretty well, losing some of its complexity to transform into a soft and gentle honeyed raisin cake.  \\n\\nUltimately it\\'s not nearly as earth-shaking to me as the A\\'bunadh was in my personal whisky journey, but I\\'m glad I got my hands on this and look forward to see the arc this series takes in the future.  \\n\\nWould I buy this again? **Yes**.   \\nWould I go to the same lengths to buy this again? **No**.   \\nThis is a good whisky at the $60-70 price tag I\\'ve seen promised for US markets, but I wouldn\\'t spend $140 on this again.  \\n\\n**Rank:** 4/5  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### Rating Scale:\\nI\\'m still working my way into tasting and reviewing whisky rather than just making a pass/fail judgement on the contents of my glass, so I\\'m opting for a shorter range of grades until I can actually break things down further. Until then the difference between a 70 and a 75 or even an 80 would likely just come down to the mood I was in that day.  \\n\\n0 | **Awful** | Screw you for pouring me this  \\n1 | **Bad** | Generally gross and/or unpleasant  \\n2 | **Meh** | Would not seek out, uninspiring  \\n3 | **Average** | Pleasant, drinkable, occasionally forgettable  \\n4 | **Good** | Delightful, would buy again  \\n5 | **Excellent** | Personal favorite, incredible, intend to hoard  ',\n",

A while later, toast (or rather white bread) with sour cherry jam appears, then bananas and some oranges.\\n* **Taste:** Ooh, spicy!

       " '**Moncreiffe-Aberlour/Glenlivet 1963** - Review #2\\n\\nSo, theres a relatively interesting story behind this one.  I\\'m relatively new to the world of scotch (3 years) and am loving every minute of it.\\nLast year I decided to check the local liquor store near my new apartment looking to add a new bottle of my cabinet in celebration of the ending \\nof the school year.  The place is owned by an adorable old couple who have been the caretakers of the store for more than 40 years, and they run\\na nice, quaint, classy place, especially for a college town so I try and give them all of the patronage that I can.  They have a nice but relatively\\nsmall scotch section, but while looking at their other wares I noticed in the back corner of the store they had a small shelf with a few very old\\nbottles of scotch that they were selling for $80 each.  I asked them about it but they said they didn\\'t have any information about them as they were\\nnever logged into their store records and were found in the back of their storage room when they were moving to their new location.  After doing\\nsome research, I went and bought one immediately and it was a scotch experience like I\\'ve never had before.  Whilst purchasing my own bottle I \\ntold the owners that they had these bottles priced many times below their market value.  I didn\\'t seem them last time I was in there so I hope\\nthey were able to get something better out of them.  While opening the bottle the cork started to disintegrate.  I was worried that the contents\\nmight have suffered, but to my relief that was not the case.  I decanted into a different bottle.  Anyhow, here are my notes on it:\\n\\n* **Info:** Purchased for 80 USD at local store, 46% abv, Non chill filtered, 23 years old (distilled 1963, bottled 1986)\\n\\n* **Color:** -3, light straw color, white wine.  Very light for an older whisky\\n\\n* **Nose:** Big, sweet yellow fruits, golden syrup, Apples, Lemon-Lime, creamy Pineapple, wood spices, Something slightly floral, Wood varnish, some intense herbal notes like sage and anise.\\n\\t\\t  The flavors really pop out of this nose.  With some water and time the sweetness and spices integrated into something like lemon merengue pie.\\n\\n* **Palate:** The taste starts out very subtly sweet with a big fruity blast that is indicative of the nose, very smooth mouthfeel.  The fruit backs off and the herbs come to the forefront as its held\\n\\t\\tin the mouth.\\n\\n* **Finish:** The length of the finish is unmatched to any scotch I\\'ve tried before or since.  Dark, earthy flavors, dark caramel, fudge, wood spices and finally, a slight marine flavor (salty seaweed)\\n\\n* **Conclusions:** Consuming this bottle was an incredible experience and really gave me some insight into what scotch can really be in terms of complexity of flavor.  It was a bit surreal drinking something made before my father was born.\\n\\t\\t\\tThis definately featured some of what I\\'ve heard referred to as \"Old Bottle Effect\" (solventy notes), which makes sense as it was bottled in the 80\\'s.  A very good whisky which is completely unlike anything Aberlour makes today.\\n\\nShould have bought the other bottles (facepalm)\\n\\n**92/100**',\n",

       " \"*What, in the name of all that is malty, is Abhainn Dearg?*\\n\\nWell, it's an unpronounceable distillery for one. It's in the Outer Hebrides. Yes. *Outer* The first, apparently. It's on the Isle of Lewis.\\n\\nThey'll be saving a proper release for when it's 10 years old in 2018 but till then they've released spirit and a ludicrously priced single cask (£150 for 50cl).\\n\\nThat would be enough to not bother with but they also do miniatures and I just happened to spy one in Inverness airport the other day.\\n\\nSince the start of the year I've made it my mission to try a whisky from every distillery in Scotland currently available. So now I've got Wolfburn left (we won't count Kininvie for various reasons). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Abhainn Dearg 3yo Single Cask 46%**\\n \\n**Colour:** Light Straw\\n\\n**Body:** Light/Medium\\n \\n**Nose:** Light, very malty, very traditional style. Lemon, toasty, toasted oak, spice rack, loads of clove, cardamom, slightly nutty, fresh bread, earthy malt. Aromatic actually.\\n \\n**Taste:** Light, spicy and malty. Very malty actually. Lots of clove, cardamom, toasted oak, traditional malting floor smell, a little toffee into the finish.\\n \\n**Finish:** Medium length. Spiced and nutty with more toasty oak.\\n \\n**70/100**\\n\\nDoesn't taste like a 3 years old. Really interesting stuff. Reminds me of a very malty 10yo Blair Athol I had.\",\n",
       " \"Let me preface this review with a little info on the distillery. Abhainn Dearg (pronounced Aveen Jarræk) opened in 2008 on the Isle of Lewis. Their only available single malt is 3 years old and their only other product is too young to be classified as Scotch. This single malt is non chill filtered, uncolored, 46% abv, single cask and bottled by hand.\\n\\n**Color:** Pale yellow, almost no color at all.\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, vanilla, candied fruits and cinnamon. The smell of alcohol is quite pervasive without the addition of water.\\n\\n**Taste:** Rather new-makey. Malt, honey, and a dollop of paint.\\n\\n**Finish:** Somewhat short. Twigs and nuts.\\n\\n**Rating:** 75/100\\n\\nI've never had Scotch this young, and for good reason. It really isn't mature enough to make a finished product. Having said that, it's by no means bad and it's quite easy to see the potential in this spirit given a few more years in the barrel. While I wouldn't pay retail price for this (150 pounds for a 500 ml bottle), I'm glad I purchased the miniature and wait eagerly to taste a more mature Abhainn Dearg single malt.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: the picture I used was for the cask strength version, which is not the one I reviewed.\",\n",

       " 'I’m curious to know what those of you that have tried many/most of the AB special releases think of them. I’ve had the vanilla bean and another one I don’t remember, and it’s been a mixed bag. This one is a blend of bourbons finished in Touriga and Merlot casks, aged for a total of 11 years (1 year 9 months in wine barrels). Let’s see how it turned out…\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman – Touriga & Merlot Wine Finished – 50%**\\n\\n* **Setup:** GNR15M\\n* **Color:** [Old Oak 1.8](http://i.imgur.com/cjuqU69.jpg) \\n* **Nose:** Pretty mild, bourbon-y nose. Oak and vanilla, are prominent, but there’s a hint of something else in the background.\\n* **Palate:** Not overly hot, but still has a decent body. Full of red fruit, raisins, and with some oak to balance the sweetness out. After a few sips, you start wishing there was more oak as the fruity sweetness does become a bit much.\\n* **Finish:** Sweet and fruity – the oak is completely gone here. \\n* **Thoughts:** Not bad at all, and one of the better examples of a wine-finished bourbon. I wish it had some more oak on the palate to balance out the fruit, but it’s still enjoyable in smaller doses. That little bit of oak would probably bring this up to a 4.5, but as it is…\\n* **Score:** **3.5/5** \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nScoring legend:\\n\\n* 5: fantastic, some of the best in its category\\n* 4: quite good, might seek out a bottle\\n* 3: average, ok to drink but I won’t seek out a bottle\\n* 2: sub-par, flawed but mixable\\n* 1: disgusting, stay away',\n",

It’s very pleasant, but a little on the simple side.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - I liked this bourbon, but I kept on wondering what could have been if this was a higher proof.  It was pretty good, but the finish was a little bit lacking and I wonder if this would shine at a higher proof.

That other cask had the following history:\\n\\n- original use was to age bourbon from A Smith Bowman for 4 and a half years\\n\\n- second use was for these barrels to age a Gingerbread Stout (6 barrels) and an Imperial Milk Stout (4 barrels) from Hardywood Park Craft Brewery for 8 months\\n\\n- final use of the barrels was to age this bourbon for an additional 17 months\\n\\n**Tasted** - Neat in a Glencairn after resting ~15 minutes\\n\\n**Nose** - I really struggled here with the nose on this one as it was very different than anything that I've tasted.  I think what I eventually landed on here was S'mores.  It was very subtle but I would go with graham crackers, cocoa, and a really small hint of toasted marshmallows.\\n\\n**Taste** - Once again this was a unique beast here.  For tasted I would highlight a flat root beer, cocoa, and a slight hint of marshmallow.  I also think that the oak really started to come through in the taste as well.  It was very enjoyable, but I think they pulled these at the right time as I don't think additional aging would have helped.\\n\\n**Finish** - This definitely had a finish that was on the longer side.  The oak really stayed and coated my tongue and faded very slowly.  I got a little bit of dark chocolate on the finish as well.\\n\\n\\n**Final Thoughts** - I really enjoyed this bourbon.  The more that I had at this tasting the more that I wished this was from a bottle on my bar rather than a small sample.  I could imagine going back to this one and liking it more with each passing trip.  I had a very tough time finishing this one up with a score.  My biggest critique here would be that I think they could have put this one at a higher proof.  There was no burn anywhere to speak of.  I waited the full 15 minutes before even venturing a nose but I'd be curious if anyone had a different experience here with nosing from the start\\n\\n**Overall Rating - 91**\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n**Ratings History:**\\n\\n91 - Abraham Bowman #15 - Gingerbread Cocoa Finished\\n\\n87 - Russell Reserve Single Barrel\\n\\n79 - Knob Creek Single Barrel\",\n",

My bad. ¯\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\n\\nWe're in full fall swing over here!  With the cold weather slowly coming in I was very excited to pop this sample open and get my fall on with this 9 year old bourbon finished for 6 months in cider casks. \\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet acetone, cider, vanilla, caramel, oak.  Apple candy. \\n\\n**Taste:** It's a smooth bourbon with an extra pinch of sweetness.  It's wildly pleasant, oak, vanilla, sweet... caramel?  Rye spice.  \\n\\n**Finish:** It's a light finish that tastes like apples.  I didn't really get much apple on the taste, but it definitely asserts itself in the finish and lingers. \\n\\n**Notes:** The color is this beautiful deep amber with a slight pinkness to it.  It's a wildly pleasant drink, but it's not particularly complex.  I don't know that I'd pay $70 for it, but it IS worth supporting a local distillery's attempts at unique finishes.  \\n\\nScrew it, if they come out with this again (or if I hadn't just spent too much money on fall releases) I would totally buy this.

       " 'Couple things to get out of the way.\\n\\nFirst up: **Yes, I know my glasses are cloudy.** It\\'s not dirt, I am just really, really bad at polishing my glasses. Also the last two weeks have been a whirlwind of insanity in my life, and if I could tell you, the reader, about it, I would, however I can\\'t so I won\\'t.\\n\\nThe TOModera house is quite hectic, at the moment.\\n\\nSecond, thank you to /u/Randimosity for the chance to finally try out this distilleries\\' offering. Seriously, this is one of the American Whiskies that I suspected would slip through the cracks.\\n\\nFinally, (yeah, I know I said couple, sue me) this is my 50th whiskey review here on /r/bourbon, so I\\'ll be taking my full flag please.\\n\\nLet\\'s get into it then.\\n\\n**A. Smith Bowman** distillery is located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Not exactly the typical place, it was the only distillery there from 1934 to the 1950s. Currently owned by Sazerac, it\\'s a microdistillery that pops up here every so often.\\n\\nToday I\\'ll be looked at Abraham Bowman Very Rare releases. Named after Colonel Abraham Bowman, who commanded the 8th Virginia Regiment, and was the great granfather of Abraham Bowman, founder of the distillery.\\n\\nBut enough history, let\\'s get to the booze!\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Price:** Not Available in Ontario\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMy wife picked out the order of whisky, and each of these were given their own \"tasting\" times.\\n\\nUp first, the one that caught our attention the most, the **Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish**. Why bury the lead? It\\'s my 50th review, I\\'ll cry if I want to.\\n\\nThis is the result of a barrel swap with Hardywood Brewery. They make a Gingerbread Stout, using ex-Bourbon barrels from A. Smith Bowman. Then they are used in a finish on this under 8 year old bourbon.\\n\\nAnd then I guess someone cackles, there\\'s a storm, they raise it up to the lightening, and then there\\'s yells of \"It\\'s Alive\" over and over again.\\n\\nWell, let\\'s see how this monster tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 45%\\n\\n**Colour:** Copper Gold\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, orange peel, lemon tart, cardamon, BBQ sauce, cranberry\\n\\nVery fruity. Also quite spritey. \\n\\nAlso really fucking weird nose on this one. Nothing that screams \"Hey, I\\'m an American whiskey, look at me!\" at all. \\n\\n**Taste:** Ginger candy, mint, icing, lemon candy, mineral water, grapefruit\\n\\nDo you like sweet whiskey? Because if not, you\\'ll want to let this breathe for awhile. Eventually there\\'s some earth/tart notes to balance out, however before that happens it\\'s flavour country, and that flavour is pure fucking sugar.\\n\\nWhich makes me happy.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cherry, nutmeg, lemon, charcoal, sea air, rosemary, woody, sesame, hops\\n\\nWhat in the heck is going on here? At the end it has more of a traditional bourbon finish mixed with a bunch of flavours I wasn\\'t ready for. At all.\\n\\nThe hops come out a little too hard. Like, way too hard. Like proving to your parents that you\\'re a man in a woman\\'s body by showing up topless after getting size DDD boobs too hard.\\n\\nYou gotta ease people into that Steve, come on!\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is fucking weird.\\n\\nOh, were you expecting more than that? \\n\\nWell it starts out with a lot of citrus and ginger. Then goes to a grab bag of sweets, eventually balanced by some tartness. Then it finishes in a bunch of crazy flavours that taste good however don\\'t exactly jive. It doesn\\'t taste like whiskey. It\\'s crazy, and probably the craziest whiskey I\\'ve ever had, including Brora 18, which tasted like Purple Doughnut Filling.\\n\\nI enjoyed it, however I couldn\\'t see myself drinking it all the time.\\n\\n**80/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor all you apple fans, we have **Abraham Bowman Apple Cider Finish** next, because my wife is one of those \"eat your dessert and meat first\" kinda people.\\n\\nSo, A. Smith Distillery has a 9.5 year bourbon sitting around, and then the moon goes full, they grow hair in places they shouldn\\'t (unless you\\'re like me, then that means the top of your head), and badda boom, they wake up 6 months later with a massive hangover, oddly full, and a 10 year old Bourbon with 6 months in the cider barrels.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t find out where they received the barrels of cider, which would have made a difference. And why you ask?\\n\\nWell I\\'ll tell you why. I\\'ve seen some shit man!\\n\\nI stood at a local UK square and watched the royal wedding. And then went to a Cider and Cheese pub festival. Oh yeah, I\\'m scarred for life knowing that the UK not only has better cheese than us (sometimes), but also that they have palatable (to me) cider! And perry!\\n\\nSo I don\\'t know if the cider was a dry or a sweet, or made in a specific place, or what. But I know it was Apple Cider, so.. that\\'s something, I guess.\\n\\nLet\\'s just see how this tastes.\\n\\n(Also, thanks to /u/fungiside for the image, couldn\\'t find any other)\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Nose:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Stewed apples, cloves, anise, grape, violets, caramel, pear, vanilla custard\\n\\nIt smells like fall. Oh, and cider. Every so often I get pips of caramel or vanilla, which tells me that this may be whiskey.\\n\\nHowever I\\'m not 100% on that. Could be Calvados for all I know.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, apple crumble, blueberry, blackberry, mangosteen, oak\\n\\nTook awhile to get past the fall Farmer\\'s market taste, however I\\'ve found some spice and oak notes. Still not sure it\\'s really whiskey. May need additional time with it.\\n\\nAdditional time note: Still confused.\\n\\n**Finish:** Anise, blueberry, toffee, nutmeg, cotton candy, coconut flakes, honey butter\\n\\nAlright, the final little bit has some notes that I could consider a whiskey.\\n\\nJoking aside, the finish is the best part, because it ends up being more than sweets and spices.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I had some trouble scoring this one, and I\\'ll explain why:\\n\\nOn the one hand, I score all booze based on the idea of how much I enjoy it. So if I were to ever review Curacao, for instance, I\\'d probably review it poorly, because I\\'m not the biggest orange fan.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this is a whiskey subreddit, and we read here and not /r/brandy, for instance, because we like whiskey. And this tastes like Apple Schnapps with spices.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I enjoy sipping it alright, but you should dock marks if you\\'re looking for that really \"bourbon\" flavour.\\n\\n**77/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSo interestingly enough, my wife is a little sick of this American Whiskey adventure for the flag, so she\\'s guessing on the one that she just wants done next: **Abraham Bowman Double Barrel**\\n\\nSimply enough, for this limited edition, the folks at A. Smith Bowman took a 6 year whiskey and put it in a new cask for 5 months in a new warehouse.\\n\\nOn a new planet.\\n\\nWITH WALNUTS!\\n\\nWait, no they didn\\'t, it\\'s just 5 months, different warehouse, new cask. Taking a note from Scotch makers, I see. It could end up interesting, it could end up a woody mess (which is normally when you stick an action figure in one of your orifices, but you already knew that).\\n\\nWell, anal splinters aside, let\\'s see how this tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, vanilla, icing, carrot cake, umami, little woody, lemon\\n\\nUh oh, ginger again... now I\\'m worried.\\n\\nAt first this reminds me exactly of carrot cake. And after being a waiter for 7 years and serving carrot cake almost every day of summer (and one fall), I wasn\\'t too happy. Eventually there\\'s some nice notes that balance out the sweet, cream cheese smell, which I\\'m happier about.\\n\\n**Taste:** Chili, wood, caramel, lemon rind, butter cream, cherry\\n\\nA little hot at first, eventually this cools down, and has some nice, bold flavours to it. Good mixture, and well balanced flavours too. I\\'m liking this.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butterscotch, wood, black tea, birch sap, vegetal, lime\\n\\nVery herbal flavour at the end, with some sweetness. If you were turned off the cider finish due to sweets, don\\'t worry: This has more balanced notes in it, which is needed.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Better than any other virgin oak finish I\\'ve had before.

       " \"Abraham Bowman is a limited release product from the A. Smith Bowman Distillery which is currently owned by the Sazerac Company.  Over the years Bowman has put out some eyebrow raising products under the line, some of which include an 18 year old cask strength wheated bourbon, a gingerbread beer finished bourbon, a vanilla bean infused bourbon, and the recently released Gingerbread Cocoa Finished bourbon. Eyebrow raising is probably an understatement because there is some wacky shit in that list for sure. I've had both amazing and bad experiences with the line but here today is another one that I would put in the LOL WTF category. From what I recall, the story here is that a local coffee roaster stored some of their beans in former Bowman barrels. Bowman then reclaimed those barrels and finished bourbon in them. It was limited to Virginia only but thanks to friendly bourbon group I was able to get my hands on a bottle.\\n\\n***\\n###**Review #236: Abraham Bowman Coffee Finished Bourbon**\\n\\n*No Age Statement but 9 years based on distilled/bottled; 67.3% ABV;  $73*\\n\\n**Nose:** Hot, woody, boozy coffee. I don't know if it's the ethanol or mash but there is a lot of angry, spicy heat. It smells like a barrel proof coffee liqueur. \\n\\n**Taste:** Everything from the nose only with more coffee influence. It is a bomb of sweet woody flavors, heat, and coffee. Like the nose it tastes like a barrel proof coffee liqueur - it's really incredible how much coffee flavor this has just from being finished in barrels that once held coffee beans. The viscosity is about as thick as you'd expect a 9ish year old 134 proof whiskey which is to say it's chewy. Again not sure if it's the ethanol or mash but there is a lot of aggressive heat spice. \\n\\n**Thoughts:** Whew, this one is a bruiser and not for the faint of heart. I've probably sampled out more of this bottle than I've drank and overall the crowd reactions seem split almost 50/50 on love/hate. The main negatives I can see are that it's hot, brash, and insanely coffee forward. As a whiskey voyeur/masochist who really enjoys aggressive cask strength bourbon, coffee, and sweet syrupy flavors, to me those characteristics are stars rather than flaws making this one of the craziest and most unique things I've ever tasted. \\n\\n**Rating: A-**\\n\\n\\n*Note that price is not considered when assigning a rating.

Metallic note is pretty prevalent.  It doesn't hurt the nose but it certainly doesn't help it.  Gets in the way a little bit.\\n\\n**Palate**: Begins with a fairly juicy mouth feel. Grape juice (+), cinnamon spice (+), loads of oak (=), metallic note shows up again (-) \\n\\nOak and spice for days, which is thrown off a lot by this metallic note but otherwise pretty tasty if simple\\n\\n**Finish**: Spicy start (+), oak bitterness (-), long grassy grain note continues for a long time after the oak subsides (=).\\n\\n**Overall**: That metallic note indicates that this is Buffalo Trace to me.  There's a nice and spicy profile but not a ton of development.  I like spicy bourbons and this is that but the metallic note ruins it for me - as it does most times.  If you like spicy bourbons and you don't get a weird metallic note from BT juice then this stuff should be on your shelf.  Also be prepared for the volume of oak it throws at you.\\n\\n\\n**Score**: 84/100\\n\\n_____________________\\n\\n\\n**After reveal**: I'm shocked that I didn't recognize the coffee.  I actually had this bourbon a few weeks ago and the coffee was overwhelming.  It could be the amount of time I let the glass sit (45 min) or it could be that I'm off my game.  The BT metal notes didn't steer me wrong though.  Apparently this bottle is fairly polarizing.\",\n",
       " 'Thanks to /u/Marcovici and /u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH for these samples.\\n\\nI am a firm believer that when a company stops innovating, they stop living.\\n\\nLook at Blackberry. As a fellow Ontarian, and someone who lost money on them, I can say that I\\'m disappointed in what they wrought. They were the brand leader of a product no one else had. And then what? They... did nothing until larger companies caught up and surpassed them.\\n\\nNow it\\'s a joke on Mr. Robot to have a Blackberry. In my professional lifetime I\\'ve watched a company go from the \"IT\" company in Canada to a sad reminder of what happens when you just stick with the Status Quo.\\n\\nI could have added in Zeller\\'s and Target Canada above and said the same.\\n\\nI could also add in Ardbeg as well.\\n\\nBut I can\\'t add in those angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night at Abraham Bowman. No those crazy nuts aren\\'t going to the point of fishsky, however they are coming close.\\n\\nI\\'ve previously talked about Abraham Bowman before in two other posts (see below). What I\\'m impressed by the most is their odd combinations.\\n\\nToday I\\'ll be reviewing two of them. And while I may not like all the decisions made in making each of these limited editions, I surely can\\'t lump them in with a lazy company.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean** sounds vile, when you first read about it. I\\'m not going to pull any punches: This sounds like one of the many mistakes I\\'ll make while reviewing flavoured whiskeys.\\n\\nHowever digging deeper into how this was made sheds some light on the situation. In Oct. 2012, vanilla beans from Madagascar were chopped up and added to the barrels. So this isn\\'t beaver anus. That\\'s a relief.\\n\\nThey even added it at various levels to multiple barrels, testing it every 10 weeks. After 2 years of this, the barrels were blended and watered down to give us this bourbon.\\n\\nThis both makes me happy and kinda worries me. I\\'m happy that the sheer amount of work that went into this bore fruit. It seems like a lot, however gives me hope it\\'ll taste better than some shitty flavoured whiskey.\\n\\nIt also worries me because I\\'ve read before of \"great whiskey\" being watered down and then not tasting as great anymore. The non-barrel strength limited edition train is something I\\'m not too happy about. I don\\'t think it automatically means this will taste poor; I just fear it, like pissing myself while plugging something in.\\n\\nSo let\\'s see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Abv:** 45%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10TR 7/10\\n\\n**Nose:** Burn, vanilla pudding, pear, orchid, creme brulée, mint\\n\\nInitially there\\'s a burn. Which normally I\\'d be worried about, however here it wasn\\'t initially vanilla, so... good sign? Maybe?\\n\\nQuite creamy vanilla. And it doesn\\'t overtake the whole thing. There\\'s floral notes, and even some sharp pear/mint flavours. I don\\'t love it, and it\\'s quite jarring, however I\\'m surprised this is flavoured.\\n\\n**Taste:** Floral, plum, a metric shit ton of butter, oak\\n\\nThe elephant in the room is endangered, Because it\\'s going to die of a heart attack due to the amount of butter.\\n\\nBecause this tastes like butter. Only like butter. I can get some other elements, some of which are vanilla based and some of which are ones I remember from the whiskey in the past releases.\\n\\nHowever yes, this is a mouth full of melted butter.\\n\\n**Finish:** Floral, molasses, cocoa, dusty, vanilla\\n\\nFinishes off kinda musty. Has this deep flavour to it. I jump between enjoying it and not so much. Have trouble with it. Almost like a floral rum in some ways, but simple and kinda has that taste in your mouth when you walk through a spider web.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The pros on this one? It isn\\'t a flavoured whiskey in the normal fashion. It\\'s quite tasty, and has taken more of the floral elements of the vanilla rather than the over-the-top-complicated flavour of it.\\n\\nThat said, while the nose is excellent, the taste is all butter. I love butter, as my weight can attest, but it\\'s unbalanced. And the finish is all over the place for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t hate this release, but I don\\'t love it either. I think there\\'s worse to drink out there. I applaud the amount of hard work that went into an interesting dram. I just don\\'t feel it was as good as it could have been.\\n\\n**73/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFirst off, I\\'d like to apologize for stealing the picture of **Abraham Bowman Coffee Finish**. It\\'s a bitch pain in the ass to find a generic picture anywhere of this. If the owner would like me to take it down, I\\'m more than happy to take it from Imgur and my Wordpress.\\n\\nSo, is this a flavoured whiskey? The answer is no sir! And if you\\'re not up to being called sir, then no mam! And if you don\\'t like that either, no buoy (the Atlantic way, not the racist way)! And if that doesn\\'t float your boat, then a simple No is all I can offer.\\n\\nInstead this is an interesting process from Bowman and [Rick Roasters.](http://ricksroasters.com/) First Bowman gives them three barrels: One that had 7 year old whiskey in it, and two that had 8 year old whiskey in it. Each of them Standard American oak barrels, #3 char. I hope that makes more sense to you, as I am quite behind on memorizing char levels.\\n\\nShame on me.\\n\\nThen they let the barrels fight. It\\'s quite dazzling for three inanimate objects. Reminds you of the first time you saw the Matrix, except without motion.\\n\\nAfter that the Coffee Company packs them full of Roasted beans. Well after aging in the barrels they then dump them out and hand them back to Bowman.\\n\\nBowman then takes a 9 year old whiskey and ages it in the ex-coffee barrel for another 6 months.\\n\\nThat\\'s impressive. So this isn\\'t a flavoured whiskey, it\\'s a finished whiskey. I\\'ve only had one other coffee finished whiskey, and the barrels in that case had espresso prepared and poured right into it. What I\\'m saying is: I\\'m not wearing underwear.\\n\\nAlso I\\'ve never had something like this before. So let\\'s see how it tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A\\n\\n**Bottle:** 206\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Abv:** 67.3%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5YR 2/6\\n\\n**Nose:** Cinnamon, coffee, sea salt taffy, jalapeno, hot, anise, ginger, wood, radish\\n\\nOkay, I\\'m floored right now. Right on the floor. So floored the floor is jealous of me being so floored with the floor.\\n\\nYes, there\\'s aspects of coffee here. However to say that\\'s the main point is false. There\\'s this hot, hot, spicy, hot jalapeno flavour that blows me away. I love it. It works so well with the spice and wood. Almost pairs really well. Slightly dominating, in the same way Christian Grey was slightly dominating.\\n\\n**Taste:** Jalapeno, espresso, caramel, peach, oak, butter, cereal, cucumber\\n\\nReally hot. I know, I know: It\\'s over 135 proof, of course it\\'s hot. But it\\'s not alcohol hot, it\\'s spicy, \"I just found a good Thai restaurant for once\" hot.\\n\\nAs time goes on the earthy aspects are more dominant. I really do enjoy that aspect. Almost like going hot to cold while eating.\\n\\nAnd as a note: I don\\'t mean to say I hate Thai food or Thai food is bad. More so, in my experience, Thai restaurants in Canada are either really, really good, or so meh that I don\\'t want to go back.\\n\\n**Finish;** Caramel, carrot cake, peach, spearmint, currant, wood, coffee\\n\\nI\\'m somewhat sad at the end. Don\\'t get me wrong, the whole dram has been tasty, and there\\'s complex flavours that can only come from coffee in this one, however I feel like it ends too much like a high proof bourbon.\\n\\nThat\\'s not a bad thing, per say. Like having someone finish you off with their mouth isn\\'t a bad thing, per say. I\\'m just saying if she was doing some crazy shit with her dick before that and then you just finish in the usual, great way, you\\'d be let down.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m overthinking this. It\\'s tasty, sweet, and has a nice finish. I just wished for more coffee flavours, that\\'s all.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is amazing. Honestly I don\\'t know why anyone isn\\'t trying this type of cask finish more often.\\n\\nSide note: I actually had a coffee bean skin floating in the dram. Really cool.\\n\\nI\\'m really blown away. It tasted so much like jalapeno and coffee and everything in between. It was unique and starting to be really, really complex. It\\'s a must buy if I ever happen upon one. I feel privileged even trying it, it was that good.\\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\n*Bourbon reviews #111-112, Virginia reviews #6-7, Whiskey Network review #680-81*\\n\\n*Other Abraham Bowman reviews:*\\n\\n* [Abraham Bowman Apple Cider Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Double Barrel](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n\\n* [Abraham Bowman High Rye](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/4bh9y5/abraham_bowman_high_rye_review/)\\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Port Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/)\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\\n',\n",
       " \"**Abraham Bowman Double Barrel Bourbon**\\n\\n*50% Alc/Vol (100 Proof)* \\n\\n*Aged for ~8 Years* \\n\\n**Background:** The normal Bowman juice is a redistilled version of Buffalo Trace Mashbill #2 (the same as Elmer T. Lee). This is that same juice but aged for 6-7 years in one new oak barrel and then aged in another new oak barrel for an additional year. \\n\\n**Nose:** The nose is nice and spicy with notes of caramel, maple syrup, oak, black pepper, black tea, rye spice, cinnamon and a touch of something floral. The heavier oak shines through without being overwhelming. \\n\\n**Mouth:** Sweet tea; nutmeg; cinnamon apple; oak; brown sugar' barrel char. Compared to the light, easy drinking Bowman Brother's (or, for that matter, Elmer T. Lee) I am surprised at how much spice the 2nd oak barrel adds. This drinks more like a rye than a bourbon. The single barrel offering by Abraham Bowman---John J. Bowman---is fairly spicy but this makes that look very tame. \\n\\n**Finish:** Cinnamon; bitters; black pepper; chili peppers; big red chewing gum. \\n\\n**Overall Thoughts:** I am always skeptical about cask finishing in a 2nd new oak barrel. It's easy to overdo the oakiness---see Woodford Reserve Double Oaked---and ruin some otherwise enjoyable flavors. This one is very spicy and full of barrel char flavors but still maintains a respectable palate. I still prefer the Bowman Brothers Small Batch and John J. Bowman Single Barrel over this but this is a decent special release I am glad to have tried. \\n\\n**Rating: B**\\n\\n**Value Rating: B.** I got mine in a trade but I think it's usually priced around $80-100. That's a little high for this and I think $50-60 would be more reasonable. \\n\",\n",
       " 'This bourbon was distilled (for the third time, presumably — A. Smith Bowman buys mash bill # 2 white dog from Buffalo Trace and redistills it in its copper pot still) on December 12, 2006, and barreled on that date.  It was aged (upright) in the standard Bowman warehouse (A1) until April 17, 2013, when it was transferred to another new (toasted, in this case, not charred) American white oak barrel, in which it was again aged for six months in warehouse A1.  The barrel was then moved to warehouse K (where the copper pot still lives and the “experimental” whiskies are stored, and according to A. Smith Bowman, “allows for increased air flow around the barrels while also allowing the barrels to receive more scrutiny” by the master distiller), before being bottled on March 3, 2014.

Sorry to say I can’t keep it stocked, because it’s a limited release.  I really like this bourbon.\\n\\nThis is really interesting, and it is a departure from the normal “finished’ bourbons in that it uses a new oak barrel just for its new oak characteristics (not to impart flavors from a different beverage, like port or sherry).  That leads to an oaky whiskey with the more aggressive new oak flavors often found in wine.  As a hop head, I would call this an “oak head” whiskey, and it definitely works for me.\\n\\nReview # 24',\n",

Smith Bowman** distillery is located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Not exactly the typical place, it was the only distillery there from 1934 to the 1950s. Currently owned by Sazerac, it\\'s a microdistillery that pops up here every so often.\\n\\nToday I\\'ll be looked at Abraham Bowman Very Rare releases. Named after Colonel Abraham Bowman, who commanded the 8th Virginia Regiment, and was the great granfather of Abraham Bowman, founder of the distillery.\\n\\nBut enough history, let\\'s get to the booze!\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Price:** Not Available in Ontario\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMy wife picked out the order of whisky, and each of these were given their own \"tasting\" times.\\n\\nUp first, the one that caught our attention the most, the **Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish**. Why bury the lead? It\\'s my 50th review, I\\'ll cry if I want to.\\n\\nThis is the result of a barrel swap with Hardywood Brewery. They make a Gingerbread Stout, using ex-Bourbon barrels from A. Smith Bowman. Then they are used in a finish on this under 8 year old bourbon.\\n\\nAnd then I guess someone cackles, there\\'s a storm, they raise it up to the lightening, and then there\\'s yells of \"It\\'s Alive\" over and over again.\\n\\nWell, let\\'s see how this monster tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 45%\\n\\n**Colour:** Copper Gold\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, orange peel, lemon tart, cardamon, BBQ sauce, cranberry\\n\\nVery fruity. Also quite spritey. \\n\\nAlso really fucking weird nose on this one. Nothing that screams \"Hey, I\\'m an American whiskey, look at me!\" at all. \\n\\n**Taste:** Ginger candy, mint, icing, lemon candy, mineral water, grapefruit\\n\\nDo you like sweet whiskey? Because if not, you\\'ll want to let this breathe for awhile. Eventually there\\'s some earth/tart notes to balance out, however before that happens it\\'s flavour country, and that flavour is pure fucking sugar.\\n\\nWhich makes me happy.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cherry, nutmeg, lemon, charcoal, sea air, rosemary, woody, sesame, hops\\n\\nWhat in the heck is going on here? At the end it has more of a traditional bourbon finish mixed with a bunch of flavours I wasn\\'t ready for. At all.\\n\\nThe hops come out a little too hard. Like, way too hard. Like proving to your parents that you\\'re a man in a woman\\'s body by showing up topless after getting size DDD boobs too hard.\\n\\nYou gotta ease people into that Steve, come on!\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is fucking weird.\\n\\nOh, were you expecting more than that? \\n\\nWell it starts out with a lot of citrus and ginger. Then goes to a grab bag of sweets, eventually balanced by some tartness. Then it finishes in a bunch of crazy flavours that taste good however don\\'t exactly jive. It doesn\\'t taste like whiskey. It\\'s crazy, and probably the craziest whiskey I\\'ve ever had, including Brora 18, which tasted like Purple Doughnut Filling.\\n\\nI enjoyed it, however I couldn\\'t see myself drinking it all the time.\\n\\n**80/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor all you apple fans, we have **Abraham Bowman Apple Cider Finish** next, because my wife is one of those \"eat your dessert and meat first\" kinda people.\\n\\nSo, A. Smith Distillery has a 9.5 year bourbon sitting around, and then the moon goes full, they grow hair in places they shouldn\\'t (unless you\\'re like me, then that means the top of your head), and badda boom, they wake up 6 months later with a massive hangover, oddly full, and a 10 year old Bourbon with 6 months in the cider barrels.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t find out where they received the barrels of cider, which would have made a difference. And why you ask?\\n\\nWell I\\'ll tell you why. I\\'ve seen some shit man!\\n\\nI stood at a local UK square and watched the royal wedding. And then went to a Cider and Cheese pub festival. Oh yeah, I\\'m scarred for life knowing that the UK not only has better cheese than us (sometimes), but also that they have palatable (to me) cider! And perry!\\n\\nSo I don\\'t know if the cider was a dry or a sweet, or made in a specific place, or what.

Could be Calvados for all I know.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, apple crumble, blueberry, blackberry, mangosteen, oak\\n\\nTook awhile to get past the fall Farmer\\'s market taste, however I\\'ve found some spice and oak notes. Still not sure it\\'s really whiskey.

So if I were to ever review Curacao, for instance, I\\'d probably review it poorly, because I\\'m not the biggest orange fan.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this is a whiskey subreddit, and we read here and not /r/brandy, for instance, because we like whiskey. And this tastes like Apple Schnapps with spices.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I enjoy sipping it alright, but you should dock marks if you\\'re looking for that really \"bourbon\" flavour.\\n\\n**77/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSo interestingly enough, my wife is a little sick of this American Whiskey adventure for the flag, so she\\'s guessing on the one that she just wants done next: **Abraham Bowman Double Barrel**\\n\\nSimply enough, for this limited edition, the folks at A. Smith Bowman took a 6 year whiskey and put it in a new cask for 5 months in a new warehouse.\\n\\nOn a new planet.\\n\\nWITH WALNUTS!\\n\\nWait, no they didn\\'t, it\\'s just 5 months, different warehouse, new cask. Taking a note from Scotch makers, I see. It could end up interesting, it could end up a woody mess (which is normally when you stick an action figure in one of your orifices, but you already knew that).\\n\\nWell, anal splinters aside, let\\'s see how this tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, vanilla, icing, carrot cake, umami, little woody, lemon\\n\\nUh oh, ginger again... now I\\'m worried.\\n\\nAt first this reminds me exactly of carrot cake. And after being a waiter for 7 years and serving carrot cake almost every day of summer (and one fall), I wasn\\'t too happy. Eventually there\\'s some nice notes that balance out the sweet, cream cheese smell, which I\\'m happier about.\\n\\n**Taste:** Chili, wood, caramel, lemon rind, butter cream, cherry\\n\\nA little hot at first, eventually this cools down, and has some nice, bold flavours to it. Good mixture, and well balanced flavours too. I\\'m liking this.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butterscotch, wood, black tea, birch sap, vegetal, lime\\n\\nVery herbal flavour at the end, with some sweetness. If you were turned off the cider finish due to sweets, don\\'t worry: This has more balanced notes in it, which is needed.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Better than any other virgin oak finish I\\'ve had before. Which isn\\'t saying much, as I\\'ve never really been with that many virgins.\\n\\nJoking aside, I think this has taken what may have been an everyday bourbon and elevated it to an interesting dram. I\\'d actually consider buying a bottle of this, if I could.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n',\n",

I haven't had any Abraham Bowman to date, but I've heard good things about this one. This is 18 years old and bottled at 69.3%.\\n\\n**Nose** Big, bold bourbon nose with fresh oak, brown sugar, vanilla, and red delicious apples\\n\\n**Mouthfeel** Extraordinarily oily\\n\\n**Palate** Very hot at first, but lots of sweet vanilla and caramel lingering behind the heat. Strong tobacco influence - if I didn't know any better, I would think I was drinking a '13 George T. Stagg \\n\\n**Finish** Head fades somewhat leaving creamed corn, barrel char, and pepper\\n\\n**Balance** A little hot on palate, but otherwise very nice\\n\\n**Rating 91/100** Very nice - it's so similar to GTS for me which is a big complement for a bourbon. Looking forward to trying some other Bowman releases.\\n\\n**Value for the money** Looks like the last one of these sold at around $500 - I'd be comfortable paying up to $100-120 for this bottle.\\n\\n**Reviews/Inventory:** http://www.reddit.com/r/whiskyinventory/comments/2it4al/madgraf_usa_minneapolis/\",\n",

Much thanks!\\n\\nFirst up is **Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finished**, 45% \\n\\n* **Nose:** Burnt sugar, misc baking spices\\n\\n* **Taste:** Hot and sweet. Vanilla extract, ginger, molasses, graham cracker, nutmeg. The gingerbread flavors are just strong enough to let you know they're there, without dominating the experience. 3 parts mid-shelf straight Bourbon and one part Starbucks pumpkin spice latte. \\n\\nIn this way I think the producers did a good job of creating something unique without drowning out the classic bourbon flavor profile. That being said, I just really couldn't get into it; for me personally the baking spice elements, though relatively subtle, still were a mild detraction from the overall experience. This was really fun to try. If the idea of what it is sounds appealing to you then it's worth a shot. **75/100**\",\n",
       " \"Review# 11-14\\n\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish (45%, 7yrs)**\\n\\n* Nose: Caramel, vanilla, honey, ginger and spices, hints of wheat and malt\\n* Taste: Animal crackers, vanilla, molasses, Christmas spices; fairly sweet with bit a rye-like sharpness without any of the dill notes\\n* Finish: Light, spicy at the beginning and mildly oaky at the end  \\n\\n* Notes: I didn't care too much for this when I first opened it but it's grown on me. It has enough of the familiar qualities to remind you that it's a bourbon at the core but has some extra characteristics to keep it interesting.\\nI feel like the finish really tones down some of the bitter oak notes that bourbons often have and replaces them with a lot of sweetness and spice. However, this comes at a cost; it's a bit too light and it's lacking the richness I would want to see from something great.\\nStill, worth a try for something a little different. \\nScore: 8.7/10.0\\n---\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Port Finish (50%, 12yrs)**\\n\\n* Nose: Stewed cherries, heady notes of hardwoods, toffee, caramel\\n* Taste: Molasses, fruit leather, charred oak, hint of spice and orange bitters \\n* Finish: Rich and dark, medium/long length \\n\\n* Notes: All the sweetness of the Gingerbread Beer Finish without losing the heavy oak notes. The port finish is definitely present in the glass and really ups the richness of the drink. \\nBetter than the regular Angel's Envy; I would love to compare this with the CS version. \\nScore: 9.1/10.0\\n---\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Double Barrel Finish (50%, 7yrs)**\\n\\n* Nose: Wood chips, dark honey, a little sweet vanilla and sugar\\n* Taste: Heavy on the burnt oak, nougat, walnuts, some vanilla and caramel\\n* Finish: Shorter than expected, fairly oaky and dry\\n\\n* Notes: This was a a little too one-dimensional for me to rate highly. There's nothing in particular that's off putting about it, but I like my whisky to have more depth and complexity in flavor. \\nIf I were more into the older stuff that tends to be more on the oaky, astringent side of the taste spectrum, I imagine I would like this a lot more. \\nScore: 8.4/10.0\\n---\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Cider Finish (50%, 9yrs)**\\n\\n* Nose: Green apples, oak, apple vinaigrette, cinnamon, nutmeg, unrolled tobacco\\n* Taste: Green apples, black pepper, burnt marshmallows, caramel, turbinado sugar\\n* Finish: Very light and crisp; more of the oak comes out at the end to remind you that there's bourbon somewhere in here\\n\\n* Notes: First thought - crazy weird. I found this hard to review with the mindset of matching the nosing/tasting notes with typical bourbon characteristics. \\nThe cider finish is overwhelming here and it smells/tastes like a completely new spirit with some bourbon notes, rather than a bourbon with some small tweaks. \\nI think this one's a love it/hate it deal. Right now, I can't say I'm a fan but it's worth trying for the novelty. Maybe it'll grow on me like the Gingerbread Beer. \\nScore: ???/10.0\\n---\",\n",
       " 'Couple things to get out of the way.\\n\\nFirst up: **Yes, I know my glasses are cloudy.** It\\'s not dirt, I am just really, really bad at polishing my glasses. Also the last two weeks have been a whirlwind of insanity in my life, and if I could tell you, the reader, about it, I would, however I can\\'t so I won\\'t.\\n\\nThe TOModera house is quite hectic, at the moment.\\n\\nSecond, thank you to /u/Randimosity for the chance to finally try out this distilleries\\' offering. Seriously, this is one of the American Whiskies that I suspected would slip through the cracks.\\n\\nFinally, (yeah, I know I said couple, sue me) this is my 50th whiskey review here on /r/bourbon, so I\\'ll be taking my full flag please.\\n\\nLet\\'s get into it then.\\n\\n**A. Smith Bowman** distillery is located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Not exactly the typical place, it was the only distillery there from 1934 to the 1950s. Currently owned by Sazerac, it\\'s a microdistillery that pops up here every so often.\\n\\nToday I\\'ll be looked at Abraham Bowman Very Rare releases. Named after Colonel Abraham Bowman, who commanded the 8th Virginia Regiment, and was the great granfather of Abraham Bowman, founder of the distillery.\\n\\nBut enough history, let\\'s get to the booze!\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Price:** Not Available in Ontario\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMy wife picked out the order of whisky, and each of these were given their own \"tasting\" times.\\n\\nUp first, the one that caught our attention the most, the **Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish**. Why bury the lead? It\\'s my 50th review, I\\'ll cry if I want to.\\n\\nThis is the result of a barrel swap with Hardywood Brewery. They make a Gingerbread Stout, using ex-Bourbon barrels from A. Smith Bowman. Then they are used in a finish on this under 8 year old bourbon.\\n\\nAnd then I guess someone cackles, there\\'s a storm, they raise it up to the lightening, and then there\\'s yells of \"It\\'s Alive\" over and over again.\\n\\nWell, let\\'s see how this monster tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 45%\\n\\n**Colour:** Copper Gold\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, orange peel, lemon tart, cardamon, BBQ sauce, cranberry\\n\\nVery fruity. Also quite spritey. \\n\\nAlso really fucking weird nose on this one. Nothing that screams \"Hey, I\\'m an American whiskey, look at me!\" at all. \\n\\n**Taste:** Ginger candy, mint, icing, lemon candy, mineral water, grapefruit\\n\\nDo you like sweet whiskey? Because if not, you\\'ll want to let this breathe for awhile. Eventually there\\'s some earth/tart notes to balance out, however before that happens it\\'s flavour country, and that flavour is pure fucking sugar.\\n\\nWhich makes me happy.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cherry, nutmeg, lemon, charcoal, sea air, rosemary, woody, sesame, hops\\n\\nWhat in the heck is going on here? At the end it has more of a traditional bourbon finish mixed with a bunch of flavours I wasn\\'t ready for. At all.\\n\\nThe hops come out a little too hard. Like, way too hard. Like proving to your parents that you\\'re a man in a woman\\'s body by showing up topless after getting size DDD boobs too hard.\\n\\nYou gotta ease people into that Steve, come on!\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is fucking weird.\\n\\nOh, were you expecting more than that? \\n\\nWell it starts out with a lot of citrus and ginger. Then goes to a grab bag of sweets, eventually balanced by some tartness. Then it finishes in a bunch of crazy flavours that taste good however don\\'t exactly jive. It doesn\\'t taste like whiskey. It\\'s crazy, and probably the craziest whiskey I\\'ve ever had, including Brora 18, which tasted like Purple Doughnut Filling.\\n\\nI enjoyed it, however I couldn\\'t see myself drinking it all the time.\\n\\n**80/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor all you apple fans, we have **Abraham Bowman Apple Cider Finish** next, because my wife is one of those \"eat your dessert and meat first\" kinda people.\\n\\nSo, A. Smith Distillery has a 9.5 year bourbon sitting around, and then the moon goes full, they grow hair in places they shouldn\\'t (unless you\\'re like me, then that means the top of your head), and badda boom, they wake up 6 months later with a massive hangover, oddly full, and a 10 year old Bourbon with 6 months in the cider barrels.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t find out where they received the barrels of cider, which would have made a difference. And why you ask?\\n\\nWell I\\'ll tell you why. I\\'ve seen some shit man!\\n\\nI stood at a local UK square and watched the royal wedding. And then went to a Cider and Cheese pub festival. Oh yeah, I\\'m scarred for life knowing that the UK not only has better cheese than us (sometimes), but also that they have palatable (to me) cider! And perry!\\n\\nSo I don\\'t know if the cider was a dry or a sweet, or made in a specific place, or what. But I know it was Apple Cider, so.. that\\'s something, I guess.\\n\\nLet\\'s just see how this tastes.\\n\\n(Also, thanks to /u/fungiside for the image, couldn\\'t find any other)\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Nose:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Stewed apples, cloves, anise, grape, violets, caramel, pear, vanilla custard\\n\\nIt smells like fall. Oh, and cider. Every so often I get pips of caramel or vanilla, which tells me that this may be whiskey.\\n\\nHowever I\\'m not 100% on that. Could be Calvados for all I know.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, apple crumble, blueberry, blackberry, mangosteen, oak\\n\\nTook awhile to get past the fall Farmer\\'s market taste, however I\\'ve found some spice and oak notes. Still not sure it\\'s really whiskey. May need additional time with it.\\n\\nAdditional time note: Still confused.\\n\\n**Finish:** Anise, blueberry, toffee, nutmeg, cotton candy, coconut flakes, honey butter\\n\\nAlright, the final little bit has some notes that I could consider a whiskey.\\n\\nJoking aside, the finish is the best part, because it ends up being more than sweets and spices.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I had some trouble scoring this one, and I\\'ll explain why:\\n\\nOn the one hand, I score all booze based on the idea of how much I enjoy it.

       " 'Thanks to /u/dustlesswalnut for this sample.\\n\\nIt is said, in quiet whispers where whiskey nerds gather and chitter like the fey of old, that **Abraham Bowman High Rye** starts out as Buffalo Trace product.\\n\\nHunkered away in secret barrels, surrounded by surly journeymen of yore and the odd uncle cousin, it\\'s spirited through the night to the A. Smith Bowman facility in Virginia. There, using methods that date back to the countries founding (or whenever), alchemists of different sorts redistill, age, and bottle the final product.\\n\\nThese mysterious booze binders have done many a different whiskey. They launch but a few out to the masses, never giving credence (or clearwater) to the rumours. The dukes of Kentucky are mum on it as well.\\n\\nRather than use a barrel or herb of mythical origins, the whiskey smiths at Bowman have given us mere mortals a bourbon that contains \"five times more rye\" than their standard recipe.\\n\\nDiviners have read their tea leaves to determine that portents a Mashbill close to 50% corn, 45% rye, 5% malted barley, and 2% eye of newt (some guesses may be off).\\n\\nAged for 4 days shy of 8 years, this whiskey shall bring about the end!... of sobriety.\\n\\nLet\\'s see how it tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** 7/5YR 5/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, cinnamon, cream, orange, margarine, light molasses, lavender candy\\n\\nInitial nose brings about the roots of cures mixed with the fresh lambs milk. Sticking in it\\'s place it the citrus of the Mediterranean, known locally for it\\'s bright citrus.\\n\\nAs the sun passes the sticky, light smells of the Caribbean mesh with flowering candies. It all has a oily, fake buttery smell, surely put there by alchemists to unhinge us.\\n\\n**Taste:** Caramel, floral, orange, ginger, rosemary, salt, raw alcohol, butter\\n\\nA flood of caramel, not since seen here or since, torrents down the tongue, bringing with it uprooted rose bushes fit for kings, and spices destined for aristocrats.\\n\\nThe mages are not done there though. No, a raw alcohol of hooch breathes fire to the tongue, salting the ground and leaving a buttery casing.\\n\\n**Finish:** Pepper, lemon, floral, kale, olive, oak\\n\\nGeomancers, feeling left out from the barrage of flavour, unseat dirt and throw it right into your face.\\n\\nTrees come with it, hampering a short, if rough finish.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Okay, enough Dungeons and Dragons talk. In case you missed it, this has a nice nose with some off put floral elements, a nice (at first) flavour that is too young after awhile, and a finish that doesn\\'t do too much to help.\\n\\nIs this nice to sip on? Sure. The end is rough, but short. I don\\'t like where the taste goes after awhile, however it\\'s not a total deal breaker. And the nose is quite nice. I like the direction this **EDIT: High rye bourbon** went. I\\'m used to more floral notes, and this one (save for the end) uses them sparingly, giving something different.\\n\\nNote that I\\'m not basing this review on price. My score isn\\'t affected by it because I don\\'t like to add in price. I\\'ll echo the same thing said before: This would be a must-buy at $40-50. At the price they asked?

Smith Distillery has a 9.5 year bourbon sitting around, and then the moon goes full, they grow hair in places they shouldn\\'t (unless you\\'re like me, then that means the top of your head), and badda boom, they wake up 6 months later with a massive hangover, oddly full, and a 10 year old Bourbon with 6 months in the cider barrels.\\n\\nCouldn\\'t find out where they received the barrels of cider, which would have made a difference. And why you ask?\\n\\nWell I\\'ll tell you why. I\\'ve seen some shit man!\\n\\nI stood at a local UK square and watched the royal wedding. And then went to a Cider and Cheese pub festival. Oh yeah, I\\'m scarred for life knowing that the UK not only has better cheese than us (sometimes), but also that they have palatable (to me) cider! And perry!\\n\\nSo I don\\'t know if the cider was a dry or a sweet, or made in a specific place, or what. But I know it was Apple Cider, so.. that\\'s something, I guess.\\n\\nLet\\'s just see how this tastes.\\n\\n(Also, thanks to /u/fungiside for the image, couldn\\'t find any other)\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Nose:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Stewed apples, cloves, anise, grape, violets, caramel, pear, vanilla custard\\n\\nIt smells like fall. Oh, and cider. Every so often I get pips of caramel or vanilla, which tells me that this may be whiskey.\\n\\nHowever I\\'m not 100% on that. Could be Calvados for all I know.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cinnamon, apple crumble, blueberry, blackberry, mangosteen, oak\\n\\nTook awhile to get past the fall Farmer\\'s market taste, however I\\'ve found some spice and oak notes. Still not sure it\\'s really whiskey. May need additional time with it.\\n\\nAdditional time note: Still confused.\\n\\n**Finish:** Anise, blueberry, toffee, nutmeg, cotton candy, coconut flakes, honey butter\\n\\nAlright, the final little bit has some notes that I could consider a whiskey.\\n\\nJoking aside, the finish is the best part, because it ends up being more than sweets and spices.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I had some trouble scoring this one, and I\\'ll explain why:\\n\\nOn the one hand, I score all booze based on the idea of how much I enjoy it. So if I were to ever review Curacao, for instance, I\\'d probably review it poorly, because I\\'m not the biggest orange fan.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this is a whiskey subreddit, and we read here and not /r/brandy, for instance, because we like whiskey. And this tastes like Apple Schnapps with spices.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I enjoy sipping it alright, but you should dock marks if you\\'re looking for that really \"bourbon\" flavour.\\n\\n**77/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSo interestingly enough, my wife is a little sick of this American Whiskey adventure for the flag, so she\\'s guessing on the one that she just wants done next: **Abraham Bowman Double Barrel**\\n\\nSimply enough, for this limited edition, the folks at A. Smith Bowman took a 6 year whiskey and put it in a new cask for 5 months in a new warehouse.\\n\\nOn a new planet.\\n\\nWITH WALNUTS!\\n\\nWait, no they didn\\'t, it\\'s just 5 months, different warehouse, new cask. Taking a note from Scotch makers, I see. It could end up interesting, it could end up a woody mess (which is normally when you stick an action figure in one of your orifices, but you already knew that).\\n\\nWell, anal splinters aside, let\\'s see how this tastes.\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** Rose Brown\\n\\n**Nose:** Ginger, vanilla, icing, carrot cake, umami, little woody, lemon\\n\\nUh oh, ginger again... now I\\'m worried.\\n\\nAt first this reminds me exactly of carrot cake. And after being a waiter for 7 years and serving carrot cake almost every day of summer (and one fall), I wasn\\'t too happy. Eventually there\\'s some nice notes that balance out the sweet, cream cheese smell, which I\\'m happier about.\\n\\n**Taste:** Chili, wood, caramel, lemon rind, butter cream, cherry\\n\\nA little hot at first, eventually this cools down, and has some nice, bold flavours to it. Good mixture, and well balanced flavours too. I\\'m liking this.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butterscotch, wood, black tea, birch sap, vegetal, lime\\n\\nVery herbal flavour at the end, with some sweetness. If you were turned off the cider finish due to sweets, don\\'t worry: This has more balanced notes in it, which is needed.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Better than any other virgin oak finish I\\'ve had before. Which isn\\'t saying much, as I\\'ve never really been with that many virgins.\\n\\nJoking aside, I think this has taken what may have been an everyday bourbon and elevated it to an interesting dram. I\\'d actually consider buying a bottle of this, if I could.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n',\n",

Smith Bowman redistilled Buffalo Trace mash bill #2 bourbon was infused with vanilla beans for 24 months (in new barrels, like the Abraham Bowman Double Barrel).  Apparently, beans were added in different barrels at different levels so they could be tasted as they developed, and the barrels were married at bottling.\\n\\n**Appearance:**  This is just a beautiful, deep bourbon color.  Rich.  Spot on.\\n\\n**Nose:**  Whoa!  Vanilla extract!  Over time in the glass, it softens somewhat, with typical Bowman lemon zest notes, rye spice, and cardamom.  Oak and char — the rebarreling in new oak is the most prominent in the nose.\\n\\n**Taste:**  Lots of vanilla.  Orange, cinnamon, clove, anise, maple.  It’s a bit too sweet for me, but the sweetness is well-integrated.\\n\\n**Finish:**  Long and smooth.  The oak returns, along with orange, black cherry, lime (somewhat strangely), and, of course, more vanilla.  \\n\\nRating:  87\\n\\nBuy again:  No, thanks.

       " \"A. Smith Bowman is a distillery out of Virginia owned by the Sazerac Company.  From what I've read, the Buffalo Trace distillery ships tankers of their low rye white dog to Bowman who then redistill it two more times. I imagine most of that product ends up in their John Bowman Small Batch and Single Barrel bourbons, the latter of which I think is pretty good.  A few times a year Bowman will also put out some sort of limited edition under the Abraham Bowman line that in years past saw national distribution but these days is more often restricted to Virginia and nearby markets. Here today we have one such Abraham Bowman release from back in 2014 that is a bourbon infused with chopped Madagascar vanilla beans for 24 months. According to a press release it spent a total of 7 years aging in a barrel.\\n\\n### **Review #182: Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean Flavored Whiskey**\\n*No Age Statement; 45% ABV; Distilled 4-16-07, Bottled 11-03-14; $70 (2014)*\\n\\n**Nose:** Very subtle, soft, and thin. As expected, vanilla is very predominate and is masking most other typical wood, spice, or corn notes.\\n\\n**Taste:** It tastes a little more like bourbon than the nose but the vanilla notes are even more forward now. There is a little woodiness and the proof is finally coming through with some heat but it's really hard to get past all the sweets. It tastes like 90 proof vanilla extract. \\n\\n**Thoughts:** It's not really offensive but too soft, thin, and way too sweet for me to get into it. I can't quite get my head around who thought this was a good idea. Vanilla is already such a strong component of Bourbon so why would you infuse it with more? This isn't the worst Abraham Bowman I've ever had (the gingerbread beer wears that crown) but it's certainly near the bottom. \\n\\n**Rating: D+** \\n\\n*Note that price is not considered when assigning a rating.

Very interesting. Strawberries, Cherries towards the end.\\n\\n**Palate:** Cream, vanilla, high-rye new make type youth (spicy wet paper), a touch of oak\\n\\n**Finish:** Spicy rye and oak.  A fair bit spicier than expected.\\n\\n**Overall:** Pretty young.  The nose is nifty with the eggnog note.  As new bourbons/ryes go, this one is pretty good.  It isn't chill filtered which is nice.

       " 'Thanks to /u/Marcovici and /u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH for these samples.\\n\\nI am a firm believer that when a company stops innovating, they stop living.\\n\\nLook at Blackberry. As a fellow Ontarian, and someone who lost money on them, I can say that I\\'m disappointed in what they wrought. They were the brand leader of a product no one else had. And then what? They... did nothing until larger companies caught up and surpassed them.\\n\\nNow it\\'s a joke on Mr. Robot to have a Blackberry. In my professional lifetime I\\'ve watched a company go from the \"IT\" company in Canada to a sad reminder of what happens when you just stick with the Status Quo.\\n\\nI could have added in Zeller\\'s and Target Canada above and said the same.\\n\\nI could also add in Ardbeg as well.\\n\\nBut I can\\'t add in those angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night at Abraham Bowman. No those crazy nuts aren\\'t going to the point of fishsky, however they are coming close.\\n\\nI\\'ve previously talked about Abraham Bowman before in two other posts (see below). What I\\'m impressed by the most is their odd combinations.\\n\\nToday I\\'ll be reviewing two of them. And while I may not like all the decisions made in making each of these limited editions, I surely can\\'t lump them in with a lazy company.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean** sounds vile, when you first read about it. I\\'m not going to pull any punches: This sounds like one of the many mistakes I\\'ll make while reviewing flavoured whiskeys.\\n\\nHowever digging deeper into how this was made sheds some light on the situation. In Oct. 2012, vanilla beans from Madagascar were chopped up and added to the barrels. So this isn\\'t beaver anus. That\\'s a relief.\\n\\nThey even added it at various levels to multiple barrels, testing it every 10 weeks. After 2 years of this, the barrels were blended and watered down to give us this bourbon.\\n\\nThis both makes me happy and kinda worries me. I\\'m happy that the sheer amount of work that went into this bore fruit. It seems like a lot, however gives me hope it\\'ll taste better than some shitty flavoured whiskey.\\n\\nIt also worries me because I\\'ve read before of \"great whiskey\" being watered down and then not tasting as great anymore. The non-barrel strength limited edition train is something I\\'m not too happy about. I don\\'t think it automatically means this will taste poor; I just fear it, like pissing myself while plugging something in.\\n\\nSo let\\'s see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Abv:** 45%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10TR 7/10\\n\\n**Nose:** Burn, vanilla pudding, pear, orchid, creme brulée, mint\\n\\nInitially there\\'s a burn. Which normally I\\'d be worried about, however here it wasn\\'t initially vanilla, so... good sign? Maybe?\\n\\nQuite creamy vanilla. And it doesn\\'t overtake the whole thing. There\\'s floral notes, and even some sharp pear/mint flavours. I don\\'t love it, and it\\'s quite jarring, however I\\'m surprised this is flavoured.\\n\\n**Taste:** Floral, plum, a metric shit ton of butter, oak\\n\\nThe elephant in the room is endangered, Because it\\'s going to die of a heart attack due to the amount of butter.\\n\\nBecause this tastes like butter. Only like butter. I can get some other elements, some of which are vanilla based and some of which are ones I remember from the whiskey in the past releases.\\n\\nHowever yes, this is a mouth full of melted butter.\\n\\n**Finish:** Floral, molasses, cocoa, dusty, vanilla\\n\\nFinishes off kinda musty. Has this deep flavour to it. I jump between enjoying it and not so much. Have trouble with it. Almost like a floral rum in some ways, but simple and kinda has that taste in your mouth when you walk through a spider web.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The pros on this one? It isn\\'t a flavoured whiskey in the normal fashion. It\\'s quite tasty, and has taken more of the floral elements of the vanilla rather than the over-the-top-complicated flavour of it.\\n\\nThat said, while the nose is excellent, the taste is all butter. I love butter, as my weight can attest, but it\\'s unbalanced. And the finish is all over the place for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t hate this release, but I don\\'t love it either. I think there\\'s worse to drink out there. I applaud the amount of hard work that went into an interesting dram. I just don\\'t feel it was as good as it could have been.\\n\\n**73/100**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFirst off, I\\'d like to apologize for stealing the picture of **Abraham Bowman Coffee Finish**. It\\'s a bitch pain in the ass to find a generic picture anywhere of this. If the owner would like me to take it down, I\\'m more than happy to take it from Imgur and my Wordpress.\\n\\nSo, is this a flavoured whiskey? The answer is no sir! And if you\\'re not up to being called sir, then no mam! And if you don\\'t like that either, no buoy (the Atlantic way, not the racist way)! And if that doesn\\'t float your boat, then a simple No is all I can offer.\\n\\nInstead this is an interesting process from Bowman and [Rick Roasters.](http://ricksroasters.com/) First Bowman gives them three barrels: One that had 7 year old whiskey in it, and two that had 8 year old whiskey in it. Each of them Standard American oak barrels, #3 char. I hope that makes more sense to you, as I am quite behind on memorizing char levels.\\n\\nShame on me.\\n\\nThen they let the barrels fight. It\\'s quite dazzling for three inanimate objects. Reminds you of the first time you saw the Matrix, except without motion.\\n\\nAfter that the Coffee Company packs them full of Roasted beans. Well after aging in the barrels they then dump them out and hand them back to Bowman.\\n\\nBowman then takes a 9 year old whiskey and ages it in the ex-coffee barrel for another 6 months.\\n\\nThat\\'s impressive. So this isn\\'t a flavoured whiskey, it\\'s a finished whiskey. I\\'ve only had one other coffee finished whiskey, and the barrels in that case had espresso prepared and poured right into it. What I\\'m saying is: I\\'m not wearing underwear.\\n\\nAlso I\\'ve never had something like this before. So let\\'s see how it tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A\\n\\n**Bottle:** 206\\n\\n**Region:** Virginia\\n\\n**Abv:** 67.3%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5YR 2/6\\n\\n**Nose:** Cinnamon, coffee, sea salt taffy, jalapeno, hot, anise, ginger, wood, radish\\n\\nOkay, I\\'m floored right now. Right on the floor. So floored the floor is jealous of me being so floored with the floor.\\n\\nYes, there\\'s aspects of coffee here. However to say that\\'s the main point is false. There\\'s this hot, hot, spicy, hot jalapeno flavour that blows me away. I love it. It works so well with the spice and wood. Almost pairs really well. Slightly dominating, in the same way Christian Grey was slightly dominating.\\n\\n**Taste:** Jalapeno, espresso, caramel, peach, oak, butter, cereal, cucumber\\n\\nReally hot. I know, I know: It\\'s over 135 proof, of course it\\'s hot. But it\\'s not alcohol hot, it\\'s spicy, \"I just found a good Thai restaurant for once\" hot.\\n\\nAs time goes on the earthy aspects are more dominant. I really do enjoy that aspect. Almost like going hot to cold while eating.\\n\\nAnd as a note: I don\\'t mean to say I hate Thai food or Thai food is bad. More so, in my experience, Thai restaurants in Canada are either really, really good, or so meh that I don\\'t want to go back.\\n\\n**Finish;** Caramel, carrot cake, peach, spearmint, currant, wood, coffee\\n\\nI\\'m somewhat sad at the end. Don\\'t get me wrong, the whole dram has been tasty, and there\\'s complex flavours that can only come from coffee in this one, however I feel like it ends too much like a high proof bourbon.\\n\\nThat\\'s not a bad thing, per say. Like having someone finish you off with their mouth isn\\'t a bad thing, per say. I\\'m just saying if she was doing some crazy shit with her dick before that and then you just finish in the usual, great way, you\\'d be let down.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m overthinking this. It\\'s tasty, sweet, and has a nice finish. I just wished for more coffee flavours, that\\'s all.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is amazing. Honestly I don\\'t know why anyone isn\\'t trying this type of cask finish more often.\\n\\nSide note: I actually had a coffee bean skin floating in the dram. Really cool.\\n\\nI\\'m really blown away. It tasted so much like jalapeno and coffee and everything in between. It was unique and starting to be really, really complex. It\\'s a must buy if I ever happen upon one. I feel privileged even trying it, it was that good.\\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\n*Bourbon reviews #111-112, Virginia reviews #6-7, Whiskey Network review #680-81*\\n\\n*Other Abraham Bowman reviews:*\\n\\n* [Abraham Bowman Apple Cider Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Double Barrel](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/) \\n\\n* [Abraham Bowman High Rye](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/4bh9y5/abraham_bowman_high_rye_review/)\\n \\n* [Abraham Bowman Port Finish](http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2vaz2b/abraham_bowman_quad_review_gingerbread_beer/)\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\\n',\n",

The soft rye predominates, I’ve had Canadian whisky where the rye is secondary, not so here. A bit of orange comes through with some air – the more air this gets the more rye notes predominate. **B+/B**\\n\\n>**Palate**: Cooling, sweet rye taste, very clean though not that deep. Again the rye is front & center but the mixing spirits (or possibly low proof) fail to provide a fully rounded taste. Lightly sweet. **B/B-**\\n\\n>**Finish**: A little sweet, some light rye, medium-long. Again, this is a fine clean whisky **B/B-**\\n\\n>**Sum Up**: Pleasingly impressed! Sure, it’s a blended whisky but it still tastes like rye, kudos old-timey whisky blenders! Glad I decided to sip this down instead of just feeding the water treatment plant. Glad I am finally starting to appreciate Canadian whisky; afterall, as a child of the Great Lakes I have long appreciated the nation & its people (not just my cousins either). **83/100**\\n\\n>**Empty Glass**: Some lightly sugary faint rye notes.

The finish is dry, with the fruits starting to fade a bit by this point. The boozy cake remains, with a light oak and nuttiness and fades on that trace of sulphur. \\n\\nThis may be rumoured to be a Glenfarclas, but the light dirtiness and bold sherry notes remind me more of a solid Glenrothes. The sulphur in this one is light throughout, more background influence integrating into other notes than being a prominent presence in and of itself.

       " 'One of the things that come up when people talk to me about whisky is blends.\\n\\nNow I’ve gone on, and on, and potentially on, about it each time I’ve reviewed one. The quick version? All blends aren’t bad, it’s just that there’s more and more grain whisky being dumped in there and that takes longer and longer to get good, which costs money. And companies exist to make more and more money, whisky is in high demand, and voila.\\n\\nBut blended malts? No grain whisky in there! It’s all pot still, single malt.\\n\\n**Adelphi Glenborrodale 8 Batch #3** is named after a small town just outside of Ardnamurchin. The rumour is it includes Tamdhu, Highland Park, Glenrothes and peated Bunnahabhain. \\n\\nBut just because I enjoy the idea behind the recipe means it’ll be good.

I do enjoy the taste going on. Good balance on it. Good salt and sweet notes.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cereal, alcohol, burnt pastry, smoke\\n\\nThe finish starts a bit harsh, but eventually, there’s some butter and smoke going on. Really hard to enjoy them with the burnt bits though.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Pretty rough and restrained. I wouldn’t mind if they dealt out some more flavour on this one. A lot of the good elements are lost in rough elements, but the taste was quite nice and had some fun aspects going on.\\n\\nI’m hoping to try future batches and see if that’s changed.

       " \"Morning, morning.\\n\\nSo following on from the Scotchit New Year Resolutions, I recall one of them was to buy a blend.  This blend in particular receive some high praise from Ralfy, and is widely available in my neck of the woods for a pretty decent price - $NZ 45-55.\\n\\nAlso a disclaimer, this is probably the first blend I have bought (and truely sampled) in the last 8 months.\\n\\n**Colour**: Dark amber.  According to Ralfy, E150 not added, but I beg to differ - no statement to the contrary on the label and a blend at 40% abv, cannot obtain this colour naturally (in my opinion).\\n\\n**Nose:** Green, grains, phenols, wood varnish, dank french fries, leather, touch of brine and a whiff of medicine.  I have to be honest here the nose tells me immediately that this is young and that it has grain whisky blended into it (being a blended whisky, not suprising, however it is obvious on the nose).\\n\\n**Taste:** Phennolic, sweet honey, light fruit and citrus.  A little peat and a little smoke.  A bit reminiscent of Talisker (faintly), a Speysider, and maybe even a Springbank note as well.  Overall, relatively light on the palate.\\n\\n**Finish:** Tannins,  dry-ish and surprisingly long.\\n\\n**Overall:** Not *bad*, but not great either.  Definitely green and definitely blend-ey.  In the upper eschelons of blends in this price range (JW Black, Chivas Regal, Grouse etc).  As far as blends go, this is very good, but for $10 more you are now into single malt territory.  The blend contains 60-80% single malts according to Ralfy, so why not eliminate the grain whisky and just serve up a straight vatting?  This would greatly improve the whisky, in my opinion.\\n\\nRecommended? Yes, but with reservations - it's a blend so modify your expectations accordingly.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Adelphi is known for being an independent bottler. If I’m being honest, I like their stuff, but lordy it’s like pulling teeth trying to figure out the stats on their bottles.\\n\\nAre they sleek and look great on a shelf? Yes, not in an “amazing glass bottle” way but in that minimalistic cool “let’s show off the whisky” way. Would I be happier with more information on the bottle? You bet your ass.\\n\\nBut we’re not here to rant about my need for information that ultimately I don’t read until I try the whisky. No, we’re here to talk about **Adelphi Private Stock Blended Whisky**. It’s a blend of whisky that comes from a solera system. What whisky goes in? What grains versus malts go in? What casks are used?\\n\\nFirst time having an Adelphi, eh?\\n\\nSo the guess is that this is made up of Islay, Campbeltown, and Speyside. So we have that, but it’s from Master of Malt, and I don’t have anything to say that for certain.\\n\\nMore importantly, how does this taste? Let’s see, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** £22.33\\n\\n**Region:** Blend\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Colour:** 2.5Y 8/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Grass, canola oil, orange, lemon\\n\\nSimple. Grassy, has some neutral oily nose to it that makes me think of canola. Some citrus. Nothing’s getting crazy here.\\n\\n**Taste:** Mango, sugar syrup, banana, basil\\n\\nSweet, sweet, herbal sweet, tropical sweet. Some sweet and sweet. Like herbal sweet or fruit sweet? We got sweet.\\n\\n**Finish:** Char, molasses, almond, woody, grain\\n\\nThe finish is where I think people there’s Islay. It’s also where I’m pretty sure more grain came in here than any blend should ever have.\\n\\nThat said… almond is nice.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Young, bit brash, got better at the end, but still rough. I get it: This is an inexpensive blend. It does that well. You go out, buy this instead of more regular Johnnie Walker Red, same price, tastes better, still isn’t great.\\n\\nPerhaps that’s just me though. I prefer to drink less and enjoy higher-end stuff. If you’re not like me and therefore not a snobby snob, this would be the cheap whisky you keep around and mix with water, ice, coke, whatever.

       " '**Adelphi The E&K: Reviewed 6/25/19 | World whisky #6, whisky #212, spirit #228, Adelphi #1**\\n\\nAdelphi is an independent bottler of spirits, usually Scotch. This is not a Scotch whisky, though it does contain some. It is a blended malt of 2 bourbon barrels of Amrut, 1 bourbon barrel of Ardmore, and some of a sherry butt of Glenrothes. This is a 5 year old whisky due to the Amrut, but I believe the Scotch whisky components are a good bit older. I’ve been very interested in this one  because I love both Amrut and Ardmore, and have heard that sherried Glenrothes can be nice. It is pretty pricey (~$160 online) but the idea is so intriguing to me that I have been tempted. Before dropping that kind of crazy money, I decided it would be best to buy a sample of it. This blended malt is bottled at a cask strength of 57.8%. Adelphi says they never chillfilter or color.\\n\\n**Nose** - Wow, incredibly thick and rich caramel. That’s not what I expected. Charred oak sweetness. Then some malty, earthy, cereal. Fresh mint, slightly earthy and herbal. Hot, though.\\n\\n**Palate** - Caramel, but slightly less. More earthy and herbal mint. A big bright citrus kick (oranges) mixed with red fruits, mixed with dirt and moss. Some lemon in here too. Bit of oak and astringency. Thick mouthfeel, chewy. \\n\\n**Finish** - Herbal and malty. Lemon poppy muffin. Strong Ardmore character coming through, really like digestive biscuit bordering on cardboard. Dark chocolate, or maybe more straight up cacao. Oak and earth. Long length, the bitterness lingering a little longer than the rest. Just a little too bitter, I think.\\n\\n**Overall** - 7/10. Love the sweet caramel on the nose. It adds a nice layer to a mostly earthy and malty whisky. A great style, I am definitely getting the Ardmore character. The wood and astringency, as well as some of the earth, strike me as coming from Amrut. Can’t speak to the Glenrothes as I’ve never had any before, so it could be contributing any number of things. The mouthfeel is great, really thick and chewy. Finish carries on well from the palate, more bitter I think, though. I debated adding water, especially for the nose, but with just 3cls I figured I’d better not risk it. All in all this is a really nice whisky. I don’t think it is so stunningly unique that a single cask of either Ardmore or Amrut (mostly the first one, but possibly the second) couldn’t get really close, though. And for that reason, I think I’d be a buyer at about $30 less, and even that would be a splurge on the quality / uniqueness to price scale. \\n\\n**Grading Scale**\\n\\n10 - Rock. Solid.\\n\\n9 - Amazing. An all time favorite, characterful, hits me just right.\\n\\n8 - Really great. The flaws here are more nitpicks than anything.\\n\\n7 - Great. Recommend this to family, friends, and whisky/spirit geeks.\\n\\n6 - Really good. Reaching territory I’m likely to buy a bottle at.\\n\\n5 - Average. Somewhat boring/safe OR interesting enough to make up for a couple things wrong. Still good, though.\\n\\n4 - Below average. Extremely boring, or too many off notes.\\n\\n3 - Needs improvement. Might be some good or interesting things here, but mostly bad.\\n\\n2 - Bad. Extremely flawed. Likely a drain pour as well.\\n\\n1 - Garbage. Drain pour after a sip or two.',\n",

On the back end the fruit starts to get a little musky. Creamy texture, lush mouthfeel. Creamy again to start, although spicier immediately as well. Juicy tropical fruit develops, turning drier and more cereal on the back half with a light nutty, spicy dry orange note. The finish is creamy, musky and spicy. There’s some pronounced cereal with the fruit musky and a little more bitter, like getting into the bits of pineapple close to the core.  \\n\\nUnlike the prior Kincardine, the Amrut is immediately noticeable and definitely the headliner in this blend. That unmistakeable mix of tropical fruit and a ton of heat, with the creamy, cereal and musky elements make this one completely reminiscent of a young ex-bourbon Amrut single cask. I can’t really detect much I’d attribute to the effects of the Glenrothes or Ardmore at all - maybe a touch of sherry in the nose and a little of the rougher edges taken off overall.

       " \"Thanks to /u/theslicknick6 for the sample of this.  For my very special 50th whisky network review, we have a very special whisky.  For a great in depth explanation of what we've got, I recommend /u/TOModera 's review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5ablei/adelphi_the_glover_18_review/).  In short, this whisky is a blend of Longmorn (35%ish) and Hanyu(65%ish), with a teaspoon of Glen Garioch, blended in England because of strict scotch law reasons, and bottled in Scotland.  There are a few different proofs of this online.  It looks like the one I've got was released last year, with a new batch released this year at 49.2%.  Anyways, let's dig in.\\n\\n*Adelphi The Glover 18, 48.6% ABV, no chill filtration, no color added*\\n\\n* **Color:** Motts Apple Juice.\\n* **Nose:** Oak, cream cheese, floral, angel food, homemade apple sauce, papaya.  A bit of mustiness.  With time, maple and nutmeg.\\n* **Palate:** Oak, sourdough, some sweet stone fruits (apricot maybe?), white cake, flour tortilla, almond, pineapple, a bit of ham.\\n* **Finish:** Very buttery.  Medium length.  Pepper, cherry, caramel, cake, cashew, lingering meat flavors.\\n\\nThis whisky has tremendous balance.  Also quite complex.  I felt like I picked up new notes with every sip.  The nose was overall quite sweet.  The palate had some fruity sweetness, and a bit of meat, but also quite a bit of bread flavors.  The finish kinda brought the two together, but also had the lingering meat.  Like if you smack your lips and meat appears.  Would love to be able to pour myself a huge glass of this and sit with it for a couple hours.\\n\\n**89/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky Review #22*\\n\\n*Japanese Whisky Review #4*\\n\\n*Whisky Network Review #50*\",\n",

       " \"Ended up splitting a bottle of this.\\n\\nSo you may be asking what I've always been asking: What, or who, is **Adelphi 'The Glover' 18**. Who is Glover? Is is Danny or Donald Glover? Because they are very talented.\\n\\nWell, no. And this may take some time, so maybe throw on Community or Lethal Weapon to help follow along.\\n\\nSo first off, Adelphi is an independent bottler of good quality. So far, so good.\\n\\nBut who is the Glover then? Well this is named after a man, Thomas Blake Glover. The man worked for Jardine Matheson, the largest British company trading in the Far East during the mid 1800s.\\n\\nAnd he goes to Nagasaki as the company's lead man. In this day and age, he'd be just another otaku from the West wanting a subservient girlfriend. Back then though? Japan had followed a strict ban on foreign trade and external influences at the time. So it'd be like volunteering to head the Jewish defamation league in Iran at the moment.\\n\\nBut good ole Thomas shows up, and he starts working and operating to try and entice those Japanese leaders who want the western technology and want to trade.\\n\\nI'll not go into his many (and there are many) achievements in trade with Japan, however let's just say we wouldn't currently have any products from Japan if not for his work. So great was his work that he was the first ever non-Japanese person to be awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. The petition to recommend him for the award included 20 pages listing his accomplishments.\\n\\nSo why name a whisky after him? Well it'd have to be one that represents the amazing whisky that has to do with Japan and Scotland.\\n\\nOr a simple way of putting it: It's a marriage of Casks from Hanyu, Longmorn, and Glen Garioch. Distilled in Scotland & Japan, blended in England, and bottled in Scotland.\\n\\n34.999% of the blend is Longmorn American oak ex-sherry casks, and a teaspoon came from Spanish oak ex-sherry butt distilled Glen Garioch. The remaining 65% is Hanyu single refill ex-sherry hogshead.\\n\\nBecause Scotland has rules against this type of thing, it was blended in England.\\n\\nHanyu is a completely different story. Originally the company was built in Hanyu, eventually producing whisky in the 1980s. Just in time for the 80s to knock the whisky industry out of it's stirrups. After the 90s gave us a single malt. And then in the year 2000 they stopped producing, and then in 2004 they tore the place apart.\\n\\nYou may have heard of the Ichiro Card series. If you're lucky enough to have tried one, I personally hate you and wish you ill due to my jealous nature. They sell for a pretty penny.\\n\\nSo. this is the closest I'll come to having this rare malt. Let's see if it's all pomp and circumstance, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A at the LCBO. We paid $224.96 from Keg n Cork, who are the only ones who have it in Canada\\n\\n**Region:** Scotland and Japan\\n\\n**Age:** 18 year\\n\\n**Abv:** 48.6%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5Y 9/6\\n\\n**Nose:** Cheesecake, floral, papaya, pine, peach cobbler, white cake\\n\\nThe initial cheesecake smell is very powerful. Smells exactly like making one, fresh out of the oven. Fat me wants to stop for a cheesecake now. Skinny me doesn't exist and may have been eaten by fat me.\\n\\nAfter the initial sweetness, there's fruit, floral, and dull, sweet notes. Non saccharine may be a better way of saying it. Cake-y may be better. None the less, tasty is the right word.\\n\\n**Taste:** Blackberry, oak, apricot upside down cake, caramel, sourdough, mint cream\\n\\nMore tart and less sweet than the nose. There's elements of bread and mint here, with creaminess at the end.\\n\\nI've had Longmorn before and it was very very sweet. So I'm to assume that the Hanyu has a sweet, but more balanced profile.\\n\\nOr at least this one cask did.\\n\\n**Finish:** Caramel, red apple, pepper steak, cherry, celeriac, butter, coleslaw\\n\\nEarthy, but not in a bad way. There's still some heat, some meat, some butter, and some fruit to balance it out.\\n\\nIt reminds me of eating a very, very high end meal where they've used red fruit and properly made meat. Granted just about everything reminds me of eating these days.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This goes from a very sweet nose, where we can handle it, to a balanced taste, where we want some sweetness, and finally a finish, where the sweetness stays just enough to balance against the other main flavours.\\n\\nI can honestly say that a Whisky that does that, be it bourbon, world, or Scotch, is extremely rare. I've had ones that will jump about, ones that have hundreds of flavours, and ones that set off memories.\\n\\nThis is new and interesting. And worth trying. Hell worth buying, immediately.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky review #166, Japan review #29, Whisky Network review #808*\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\",\n",

There is seemingly an undertone of maritime notes, but not in a prominent (or funky) way. Creamy in texture, there is a sweet and sour interplay throughout the taste. Spicy finish, trailing off into a pleasant grassy note with a lingering warmth.\\n\\nThere’s something very comforting about this one. Some unique notes contributing to the sweetness, while the sour and spice notes keep it from becoming overdone. Despite the fantastic dessert notes, with the great complexity and balance throughout I hesitate to pigeonhole this as a ‘dessert dram’. So how does this fusion whisky concept play out?

       " 'One thing you won’t see very often from me on here is a review of a Lowland whisky. Aside from the fact that there are but a handful of active distilleries in this region, I’m not really a fan of the style. This though showed up on my radar because it is peated, something quite uncommon for a Lowland whisky.\\n\\n\\nThe William Grant & Sons owned distillery shares its grounds with the older Girvan distillery, a producer of grain whisky. The Ailsa Bay distillery was added in 2007 and can be configured to produce a variety of styles of single malt, meant to be used primarily as a component in the various blends produced by William Grant & Sons.\\n\\nThis was the first malt produced there to be released under the Ailsa Bay name and was sort of a way for them to show off just how versatile the new distillery is at producing various styles, so it was heavily peated.\\n\\n**Aged 3 years * .  48.9%ABV. No colourant added and non-chill filtered.**\\n\\n**for lack of age statement*\\n\\n**Nose:** Mineral peat. Sea breeze. Ozone. Fresh tar. Green herbs, parsley and sage. Old tarred wood in the sun, like those old wooden death trap jungle gyms one used to find in public parks. Bit of smoky lemons. Honey. Menthol.\\n\\n**Palate:** A bit thin feeling at first, but it build up to a nicer mouthfeel. Salt. Earthy peat. More tar. Old rubber. Pine cones. Wood ash. Lychees. Liquorice on the swallow.\\n\\n**Finish:** Ash. Bitter wood. Rubber. Citrus oils. Paraffin wax. ome very light fruit notes, white grape juice maybe.\\n\\n**Would I buy this:** No\\n\\n**Would I order this in a bar:** Yes\\n\\n**Would I drink this if someone gave me a glass:** Yes\\n\\n**VFM:** 4/5\\n\\nFinally something I really want from the Lowlands. Not a bad dram at all. It has quite an interesting bouquet of flavours from all over the place but they seem to work well and are quite balanced. I’d like to see a more aged expression and hopefully the price will go down a little once the gimmick factor wears off, but it looks like a promising whisky.\\n\\nReviewed in my blog:\\nhttps://iwriteaboutstuffilike.com/2016/08/27/ailsa-bay/',\n",
       " \"Yes, I am a marketing sucker for buying a bottle of this. Everything about this screamed gimmick. The heavy metal and granite stopper, the thick bottomed bottle, all the shite about micro-maturation, spirit ppm and sppm. All trying to hook me. And it succeeded. \\n\\nTo be fair it does sound interesting, and it turns out it is.\\n\\nBlending different distillates from different peating levels. 21ppm in spirit, so about 36-38ppm in the malt. 11sppm, sweet parts per million, what does that mean? No idea. It pretty meaningless seeing as we've got nothing to compare it against. \\n\\nMatured partly in Hudson baby Bourbon barrels (very small). The distillery only started in 2007, so the max age is 8 years. \\n\\nBut mainly the high peating level and abv drew me to this, and I prayed to the whisky gods that it wasn't *just* a gimmick.\\n\\n**Aisla Bay 48.9%**\\n\\n**Colour:** Gold\\n\\n**Body:** Medium\\n\\n**Nose:** Different. Its neither bonfire nor medicinal peat, but it is somewhat mineral. Its a sweet peat, but no Sherry flavours. Candy floss, sweet shop, candy cane, malt, olive oil, red liquorice, a little vanilla, dirty grapefruit, some lime, chimney soot, slate, sour under ripe fruit.\\n\\n**Water:** More olive oil, more green under ripe fruit, apple, lime. More minerality too with some chalk and limestone. Loses some smoke, but gains sootiness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Mouth coating, rich and sweet. Soft arrival with under ripe mango and some acidic green apple, developing more sour, building peat, grapefruit, building lime and lemon, then more oily malt.\\n\\n**Water:** Softer and smoother, then more soot, more lemon then goes more dry with lots of wet chalk and limestone. Quite white wine-esque. Less complex but more balance.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium length. Heavy peat kicking in with oily malt and then drying.\\nQuite drying and a little longer with water.\\n\\nIt's not really that peaty. I would compare it to Bowmore in terms of ppm and given blind I'd probably have guessed an IB Bourbon Bowmore. It's probably down to the cut points. I think they've cut the feints early to tone down the phenols and medicinal notes.\\n\\nReminds me of a Japanese whisky in some ways. It's definitely been very carefully designed, so there are very little flaws, but it loses some exciting character. I tend to find a similar thing with Japanese whiskies.\\n\\n**74/100**\\n\\nI actually really like the mineral notes that come out, especially with the sour citrus but it could do with a few more years ageing I think.\\nInteresting to try but I probably wouldn't buy another bottle.\",\n",
       " '**Review No. 18:** Ailsa Bay Release 1.2 “Sweet Smoke”\\n\\n* **Age:** No age statement and I wasn’t able to find any intel on the internet nor make any sense of the bottle code\\n* **Maturation:** According to the [official website](https://www.ailsabay.com/), this release was initially “micro-matured” in small (25-100 liter) Hudson Baby Bourbon casks for 6-9 months. After this, the whisky was transferred into virgin oak, first-fill, and refill bourbon casks.for the rest of the maturation (however long that was) before being blended back together.\\n* **ABV:** 48.9% ABV\\n* **Presentation:** Non-chill filtered; not sure whether color is added. Reported by the distillery to be peated to 22 ppm (the liquid, not the malt) and have 19 sweetness ppm.\\n* **Price:** $57 USD for 700-mL bottle on Fine Drams, taking into account shipping on a multi-bottle order and correcting for volume approximately equal to $73 USD/750 mL\\n\\nThe Ailsa Bay Distillery is relatively new, founded in 2007. It is owned by William Grant and located adjacent to their grain distillery in Girvan in the Lowland Region. Girvan is a coastal community on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with views of the island of Ailsa Craig (hence the name of the distillery).\\n\\nAilsa Bay has attempted to position themselves as a highly precise and scientific operation. They measure and report the peat levels and sweetness levels of the final product. We might rather they gave us the age of the whisky and told us whether or not color was added, but oh well! I did some light googling to see if sweetness ppm is an established measurement and didn’t find much.\\n\\nSweet Smoke is Ailsa Bay’s second standard release. They seem to only produce one core release at a time, at least for now. If you go to their website it’s simply a splash page for this whisky.\\n\\nTasting in a glencairn first neat and then with water\\n\\n**Color:** [1.0 (Deep Copper)](https://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)\\n\\n**Nose:** Smokey. Initially medicinal phenol notes are prominent though they fade as the dram opens up. BBQ smoke. A sweetness like sharp apples and some toffee. Pepper. There’s a musty vegetal note (peat?) and a muddy minerality. Quite a bit going on. Adding a splash of water straightens things out and brings the toffee sweetness to prominence, along with a floral perfume. A muddy, light smokiness sticks around.\\n\\n**Palate:** The texture is light, and neat there’s a fair alcohol tingle on the tongue. Honey sweet and fruity, though occasionally I pick up a note that is reminiscent of olive brine. After adding water, there’s a sweet cocoa/chocolate note along with spicy chili pepper. Muted sweet citrus, like ruby red grapefruit.\\n\\n**Finish:** Lingering sweetness, mandarin oranges, and something sharp and metallic like a copper penny.\\n\\nDrinking neat, this whisky has a lot going on that (for me) doesn’t really come together in a coherent way. A splash of water does help, sorting it all into a pleasant toffee/chocolate sweetness with a light smoke running through it all. It’s aptly named as “Sweet Smoke”.\\n\\nI don’t know much about lowland whisky, but understand that the peated nature of this makes it unusual for the region. The reported measurements for peat level and sweetness is an interesting feature, but not that useful unless it can be used to compare to other whiskies (and for now, nobody else is measuring sweetness).\\n\\nThis whisky didn’t really excite me, but I did go through the bottle fairly quickly. It’s in no way offensive and a pleasant sipper that I found myself pouring fairly frequently.\\n\\n**Rating:** 5/10 on the t8ke scale: Good!\\n\\n**Value:** For a US-based consumer, probably not worth the effort and shipping cost to track down unless one is extremely curious. If available locally, I think it is worth the price tag.\\n\\nThanks for reading!',\n",

After you let it sit for long enough, it smells remarkably similar to the remains of a campfire in the morning after it\\'s burnt out. There\\'s a distinct alcoholic note of hand sanitizer as well.\\n\\n**Palate:** It\\'s a bit puzzling, the flavors seem to be neither here nor there. There\\'s a bit of something slightly peaty and slightly aromatic. A hint of sweet mesquite pops in every so often with a bit of tart citrus (reminded me of yuzu). None of the flavors are greatly defined, everything was a bit muddled. \\n\\n**Finish:** Medium to short in length. Hand sanitizer and a bit of aromatic peat.\\n \\n**Conclusion:** Ailsa Bay is a massive distillery that opened in 2007 on the same site as Girvan in the Scottish Lowlands. This 1.2 Sweet Smoke is their second distillery release. Ailsa Bay touts their scientific approach to making whisky which they claim helps them make a whisky with \"precise balance of sweet and smoky notes\". I was expecting something along the lines of [Bunnhabhain\\'s Toiteach a Dhà](https://scotchandsheen.com/2019/11/22/bunnahabhain-toiteach-a-dha/) to get a lovely bit of smoky and sweetness. Unfortunately, I can\\'t say I agree. All of the notes throughout this whisky are neither here nor there, it\\'s as if the whisky can\\'t make up it\\'s mind as to what it wants to be. All of the notes are a bit muddled and it lacks a bit of cohesion. It doesn\\'t help that basically all of the notes are just trace bits of something. The hand sanitizer notes weren\\'t particularly pleasant either. It\\'s a bit of a miss for me, though I\\'d love to see more of what they\\'ve got coming.\\n\\n**Final Score:** 71.\\n\\n*Scotch Whisky Review #202, Lowland Review #7, Whisky Network Review #283*\\n\\n***********\\n\\n**Scoring Legend:**\\n\\n* 96-100: The perfect dram, nectar of the gods.\\n\\n* 90-95: Near perfect, there is something truly special about this whisky.\\n\\n* 85-89: Amazing, will always try to keep a bottle of this in my collection (if feasible).\\n\\n* 80-84: Very Good, maybe only one minor nitpick about the whisky keeping it here.\\n\\n* 75-79: Good, quite enjoyable to drink.\\n\\n* 70-74: Solid, wouldn\\'t go out of my way to get it.\\n\\n* 60-69: Meh, still drinkable.\\n\\n* Below 59: If you have a bottle of this, start cooking with it instead.\\n\\n\\n***********\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of my whisky reviews and reviews of whatever else I think of can be found over on my [blog](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/).\\n\\nTo view by rating grouping:\\n\\n* [Rated 96-100](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-96-100/)\\n* [Rated 90-95](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-90-95/)\\n* [Rated 85-89](https://scotchandsheen.com/tag/rated-85-89/)\\n* [Rated 80-84](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-80-84/)\\n* [Rated 75-79](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-75-79/)\\n* [Rated 70-74](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-70-74/)\\n* [Rated 60-69](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-60-69/)\\n* [Rated Below 59](https://scotchandsheen.wordpress.com/tag/rated-below-59/)',\n",

It was youthful, but incredibly tasty.  The youth came out with some spirited heat on the palate and a flavor profile that remained relatively simple.

       " 'Happy Scotchtoberfest, Scotchit! Thank you to u/xreekinghavocx for this dram!\\n\\nWow, two-thirds of the way to a thousand reviews… This is my first-ever Ailsa Bay! They’re quite a young distillery, only opening in 2009, but they’re part of the massive Girvan grain distillery. They’re notable for trying to apply trendy technologies like AI and blockchain to whisky, for some reason. \\n\\nThis particular whisky is an indie bottling from Scotch Universe, who seem to have a tendency to chuck whiskies in various wine casks seeing what happens. This time, they’ve used perhaps my favourite wine cask, Madeira.\\n\\n***\\n\\t\\t\\n**Ailsa Bay 9 2011 Scotch Universe Ceres I.** Lowland single malt. 57.2% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Maturation:** Distilled 2011, bottled 2020 at 9 years old. Matured in a first-fill Madeira barrique. Bottled at cask strength. \\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in a glencairn. Rested about 10 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Colour:** Bright gold.\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet and spirity. Candied fruits and fruity candies, namely Fuzzy Peaches and Sour Patch Kids. Some nice maltiness: barley wort, buttery shortbread, and salted soft pretzels. Honey and cantaloupe. Peaches ‘n’ cream ice cream. Lemon oil. Very slightly dusty.\\n\\nI added a good bit of water, which gives some more fruit complexity.\\n\\n**Palate:** Medium texture, a bit hot. Honey-sweet breakfast cereals and dried mango up front. Floral and malty in the middle, with crusty bread and a hint of cinnamon. Marshmallow fluff and creamy vanilla. \\n\\nWith the water it gets slightly leafy, there’s more juicy yellow fruit.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-length. Light oak and vanilla. Lingering mandarins, frosted cornflakes, and slightly nutty. u/xreekinghavocx mentions Mountain Dew, which is both hilarious and spot-on.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Possible SMWS bottling name: “Peach fuzz electric razor”**\\n\\n**Notes:** It’s alright, but a bit too young and one-dimentional. It didn’t help that I expected this whisky to be peated, like most of the OB Ailsa Bays (yes, they’re a peated Lowland!). I can’t say I have a great idea of what the Ailsa Bay spirit is like, as the Madeira cask really dominates the whisky. I like Madeira influence, but I’d like there to be a little more in there to go with it. Those malty notes are a good sign, though, so I’ll continue to keep my eye out for this weird Lowlander.\\n\\n**Final score: 76/100** \\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. \\n\\n60-69: Not so good.

       " 'Review #47\\n\\n(Note to mods : tartan please ? :-))\\n\\nHey everyone ! Long story short, my grandma, who has been drinking two good ol\\' blend+soda per day since the early eighties, bought at that time a \"back-up bottle\" in case she were to run out of scotch some unforeseen day. But organized as she was, she never really ran out of it and never had to use it. So she forgot it … until last week-end. She decided to crack it open and remarked a slight change in taste indeed, but didn\\'t care much. I was at her place a few days ago and she told me about the story and offered me to take the end of the bottle at home so I could review it. \\n\\nAinslie\\'s post WW-2 is described as a blend of 36 malts (Highlands, Lowlands, Campbeltown and Islay) and 6 grains. They still were proprietors of old Clynelish at that time, though it is unsure which proportion of it is to be found in post WW-2 bottlings, as opposed to pre-WW-2 (see Serge notes on some brillant pre-war ainslies). Still though, one thing is sure : there is some \"Clynelish\" that was probably distilled between 1965 and late 70\\'s in this, in other words … probably some from the first and now-deceased Clynelish distillery, whose malt is called Brora since the building of the new one.  Please note that I tasted and reviewed it *prior* to knowing all that.\\n\\n**Ainslie\\'s Choice Scotch Whisky, bottled 1980\\'s**, Blend, 40%\\n\\n* **Nose** :  light but far from uninteresting. The malt content is prominent, no evident presence of grain. Three notes remind me of Bunnahabhain very much: **hazelnut paste, clay and dry honey**.  Opens very well on other soft notes : lots of **fudge** and faint fruits. **Orange**-flavoured honey and **fresh bread**. Ultra standard \"Highland\" profile so far. It\\'s only later than more interesting, un-sexy things arise : encaustic, a hint of lemony peat, **shoe polish** and clay again. Slightly **greasy** indeed. Interesting ! The only downside is you can feel some young alcohol in the background, it\\'s not perfectly integrated, but at least it stays in the background. \\n\\n* **Palate** : hey, that\\'s not bad ! Entry on **honey** again, then gets incredibly malty, I wrote **\"cereal syrup\"**. Very sweet actually, with sweetened **condensed milk** (remember ?) and soft cheese (also something very Bunna in my experience). A real breakfast ! Dried oranges. Alcohol is very well integrated and I\\'d say it punches above its weight. Grain is nowhere to be noticed. The palate then shifts towards a totally different profile : gets very nervous, like it compacts itself in the center of your mouth. Dry wood and lots of **white pepper**, some earth as well. The austere guise of the Highlands is there.\\n\\n* **Finish** : chooses to explore this autere side, not much sweetness to be found. Lots of **dry earth**, the sligh hint of peat is back, gray flour, white pepper and dust. Very austere but good at that. On the very end, a \"mentholy\" maltiness appears, think the after taste of a not-so-good **pils**. This transforms in typical bittersweet herbs : **tarragon, anise**, maybe even absinth.\\n\\n* **Comments** : well ! While it never excells in any way, this blend is still well-composed, balanced and pleasant while not trying to be so by all means, if you see what I mean. Which is a plus, definitely. Doesn\\'t revel in facility (is that correct ?), clearly doesn\\'t. The young alcohol on the nose and the pils side on the finish prevents its to be excellent but the palate is really good. Ultra-typical, but good, and definitely more than one could expect from a 40% blend of 40 whiskies nowadays. After knowing Ainslie\\'s \"story\" and the fact some old Clynelish had probably been in use, I must say it didn\\'t strike me. Sure, the shoe polish, encaustic and grease hint at it, but it\\'s not dominant. An honorable **83/100**.\\n\\nIt\\'s been too long already, my deepest apologies.\\n\\n(Edit : typos, better formulation of the Clynelish/Brora assumption - see below -, and slight score tweak after comparison with prior similarly scored drams).',\n",

Good peach, brown sugar, and oat flavour. And then that continues. And continues. Keeps going…\\n\\nAdd water. Oh. Now it’s earthy and herbal. Less sweet. I guess Sherry Cask?\\n\\n**Taste:** Peach cobbler, hot, cocoa\\n\\nSimple, peach cobbler. At first, I’m impressed, and then two seconds later it’s hot. Very hot. Lots of alcohol. Water makes earth/sweetness come out but doesn’t kill the heat.\\n\\nToo hot.\\n\\n**Finish:** Butter, lime juice, peach, thyme, cloves\\n\\nHey, the finish didn’t burn and changed things up. Good for you little guy, someday you’ll be something other than a failure. Look at you!\\n\\nButtery, lime. It’s like the peach cobbler before it’s made but each element is a bit bigger. Hard \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Overly hot, though the finish is better than expected. I mean, is it better because it’s not hot or is it worse because it’s the cohesive elements of the taste and nose? Mysteries for the cosmos.\\n\\nThis tastes very young, lots of burning, and needs more time. It doesn’t represent the interesting wacky things a white wine cask can do, rather just is too hot, too earthy, and too one noted.

       " \"**Review #12 Akashi White Oak Single Malt NAS**\\n\\nMany people think that Suntory/Yamazaki is the oldest whisky distilling company in Japan, but technically Eigashima have held their license longer.\\xa0 They made rare use of it but with the Japanese whisky boom kicked themselves into gear.  Recently I reviewed their 5 year sherry cask and I thought it quite tasty and quite expensive for what it is.\\xa0 Now lets check out the standard single malt.\\xa0\\n\\n**Country/Region:**\\xa0 Japan/Hyogo\\n\\n**Color:**\\xa00.7 Amber\\n\\n**ABV:**\\xa046%\\n\\n**Nose:**\\xa0The initial impression is a fairly generic single malt whisky.\\xa0 Almost as if Glenlossie, Teaninich and Linkwood were blended together.\\xa0 A bit spirity becoming grassy, with lime, kaffir lime leaves, light clay and mineral notes, vanilla and cinnamon.\\n\\n**Palate:**\\xa0Opens with a slightly peppery bite with lime, honey, vanilla syrup, cinnamon, clove.\\xa0 Develops with a bit of toffee, lemon, the herb savory, sage, sweet grass, and some light black tea.\\n\\n**Finish:**\\xa0Toffee, vanilla syrup, white pepper, sweet grass, building gingery heat, savory returns, a bit more bitter for a moment then going very grassy.\\n\\n**Rating:**\\xa077\\n\\n**Summary:**\\xa0This could be any good quality $60 IB from a blend filler Scotch distillery @ 46 between 7-12 years of age.\\xa0 The climate in Hyogo is quite a bit warmer than Sendai, Nagano, or Hokkaido (or Scotland), so the maturation does seem to be further along.\\xa0 This is probably around the 3 year mark and some of that immaturity shows with some heat.\\xa0 But it is aged well, the overall flavors are good.\\xa0 But here is the catch.\\xa0 At this price point (\\\\~$110) you can still buy Yamazaki 12 and Hakushu 12 and while you give up 3%, you get a whisky with alot more character and something overall a bit more pleasant to drink.  And Nikka's NAS Single Malts run about $40 less and they have more distinctive character too.

       " \"Greetings WW! Tonight, a more recent sample from the Uncle Down Under. This is a Japanese whisky - one of the handful I've ever tried. This is the smallest sample I've ever tried reviewing, so let's see how that works.\\n\\nThis one was part of an Australian bottle split, apparently, a few months back, because there was a flood of reviews and since then I've seen none. Regardless, it got rave reviews back then. It's Akashi White Oak 14, bottled at cask strength. Does it hold up to the perceived hype? \\n\\nLet's find out!\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Akashi White Oak 14**  \\n*Japanese, 56% ABV, NCF, NCA, 25ml sample from /u/UncleTobys*\\n\\n**Nose**: Rich and pungent. Plum wine and prunes. Definite smoke. Molasses and strong caramel. Red wood - mahogany or rosewood. Dark orange marmalade. Asian BBQ sauce (with duck?). Incense.\\n\\nIncredibly odd, like no other single malt I've ever smelled before. Smells viscous and syrupy, with a distinct plumminess. I'm detecting smoke, so I'm guessing this is peated, but I have no idea if that's correct or not. There's also something savoury in the mix, like Asian BBQ sauce. \\n\\nIt's hard to describe, but this just smells Asian. I've lived 8 years of my life in South-East Asia, and something about this malt smells like it belongs - incense and plums and dark wood. It's like being in a Chinese temple or a really fancy Chinese restaurant. \\n\\n**Taste**: Thick and dry mouthfeel. Dried prunes. Dark woodiness - rosewood. More incense and smoke. Slight bitterness. Dry plum wine. Seaweed. Rich soil. Wet tobacco.\\n\\nI'm so confused by this - it's not malty in the least, but rather intensely wood. The sherry isn't coming off as the traditional fruitiness, but rather a deep, dark, dry plum wine. Basically no fresh fruit influence, just dry and dark wood and smoke.\\n\\n**Finish**: Fruitier than the palate. Marmalade and prunes. Sweeter smoke, like applewood. Honeyed ham. Incense and rosewood. Tobacco.\\n\\nSweeter than the palate, but that's not saying much. Lingering woodiness and smokiness round out the experience.\\n\\n**Summary**: I honestly don't think I could drink more than 25ml of this in a sitting. It is incredibly, incredibly heavy, and probably among the most flavourful whiskies I've ever tried. This also has one of the strongest senses of place I've tried. Yes, there's Laphroaig and Talisker, which taste like the sea, but this smells and tastes distinctly like Asia. \\n\\nHowever, that's not to say this is the best whisky I've had, just one of the most distinctive and tightly-packed. This is an incredibly intense, incredibly dense whisky, but it's almost overly characterful - the other night's Sullivan's Cove was characterful, but also drinkable - this falls on the other end of that spectrum.\\n\\nSo. Incredibly interesting whisky, with enough terroir to share with a handful of distilleries. However, definitely not a daily dram. Tough one to score, but I think I'll go with...\\n\\n**Score**: 88/100  \\n*Incredible. Intriguing.*\\n\\n**Buy Again?** Not sure, but probably not.\",\n",

I know very little about this side of the whisky world.\\n\\nThis Japanese single malt from the White Oak distillery is aged two years in sherry butts and three years in hogsheads. It is lightly peated, NCF, and bottled at 50%. Sounds solid so far.\\n\\nThanks to /u/domkchan for the sample.\\n\\n**Nose** - Maple syrup, dried fruit. Chocolate cake. It’s definitely sherried for sure. Reminds me a lot of the Glendronach 12. It’s a little bit earthy, a little too nutty. There’s an interesting...musty heaviness to the nose, like there is something in the background that I can’t quite define. Might be the light peat. Coming back to it, it reminds me a bit of lint, like when you clean out the lint trap in your dryer. \\n\\n**Palate** - Earthy sherry. Rubber. There’s some funkiness here. Caramel, maple syrup. Walnuts, leather. Again, it is reminiscent of Glendronach 12 for me, in that I get this weird kind of asparagus note. Here it is much more intense, though. The youth comes out a little here, with it tasting a little hot and just vaguely off. It has a medium mouthfeel, neither thin nor thick and oily. \\n\\n**Finish** - The finish is very light. At first it feels like it disappears the second I swallow, but then it comes back. Faint rubbery sherry, almonds, walnuts. Medium length. \\n\\n**Overall** - 64/100. The maple syrup on the nose is nice, but it gets a bit muddied up after that. This is someone’s idea of a good time, but sadly not mine. I’m coming to realize I’m picky about my sherried whisky, but I haven’t really figured out what exactly it is that I like and dislike. Nevertheless, I appreciate this sample.\\n\\n**World Whisky Grading Scale**\\n\\n96-100 - Liquid perfection.\\n\\n90-95 - One of my favorites. \\n\\n87-89 - Amazing.

       " 'Thanks to /u/theslicknick6 for this sample.\\n\\nIf I have \"oops\" in my whisky reviews, it would be not getting around to some distilleries. One of which is White Oak Distillery, which I\\'m told is in the Hyogo prefecture. It\\'s too bad I\\'m utterly terrible at geography, or that would have significance to me.\\n\\nThe distillery is owned by Eigashima, who makes sake and shochu. Sake is my kryptonite... wait, not. It doesn\\'t kill me. It just makes me throw up. What\\'s that called? Oh, tequila.\\n\\nAnd Shochu and I are still in the courting period. So far it\\'s being a nice guy, if you get my meaning.\\n\\nNone the less, the White Oak distillery has been in the whisky game for a long time, but only released their first single malt in 2007. Granted they may have done so before, it\\'s debatable, as they labeled it poorly and it was back when Japan was still figuring out this whole \"whisky\" thing. For instance, Eigashima Shuzo obtained their license to make whisky in 1919, and there are old bottles they made that say \"Scotch\" on them.\\n\\nNone the less, White Oak made whisky again and it went into their blend. Which makes sense, both from a taste point of view and a financial one. Gives you time to mess about with your flavours and a regular income that won\\'t be hurt by young ages.\\n\\nSo today I try my first from the Akashi line, which is their single malt line. This specific on is **Akashi White Oak 5 Sherry Cask**.\\n\\nDo we know what kind of sherry cask? Not really. I can tell you it looks like this specific single cask was all sent to Germany to be sold online and confused me.\\n\\nBased on what I could find, this whisky is made 1 month of the year, bottled and then sent out. Otherwise you don\\'t get it.\\n\\nSo let\\'s see how this is, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** Japan\\n\\n**Cask:** 1373\\n\\n**Cask Types:** Sherry\\n\\n**Outrun:** 960 bottles\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10YR 3/10\\n\\n**Nose:** Brown sugar, cranberry, cherry pie filling, alcohol, lemon candy, fennel, raisin\\n\\nLighter baking notes abound in this one. it\\'s really, really sweet. And spicy. The youth is evident here, but not a turn off. Honestly haven\\'t had a big sherry whisky in awhile, so it\\'s a nice wake up to it once more.\\n\\nVery sweet though. If you\\'re diabetic... well, you shouldn\\'t be drinking anyway. Nose diabetic need not apply? No, that\\'s silly.\\n\\n**Taste:** Cherry pie, raisin, limoncello, caramelized cranberries, plum\\n\\nMore sweet, very red fruit forward. Very, very sweet. There\\'s a little bit of darker, non-sweet notes, but... it\\'s sweet. Very sweet.\\n\\nI mean, don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not trading in my \"diabetes is a target fat guy\" card anytime soon, but... Wow this is sweet. Needs some spice to balance it out. Or you know, something other than fruit.\\n\\n**Finish:** Caramel, raisin, anise, allspice, mushroom, ginger, yeast\\n\\nOh thank goodness some earth and spice. I mean, it\\'s at the end, and it\\'s late, and we needed it awhile ago, and this is still very sweet but... I mean, it showed up right. So that\\'s something.\\n\\nWhy did it not bring back the milk it promised?\\n\\n**Conclusion:** It\\'s hard to review this. As someone who loves sweets, it should be up my alley. But as someone who likes a more balanced whisky and spice, it\\'s not.\\n\\nThis is really, really sweet. I can see why some people swear by it. Frankly I\\'m shocked that it\\'s so young, because beyond some light notes at the start, this is pretty impressive. They aren\\'t hyper aging this. Spain must have sent them some really good casks, that\\'s all I\\'m saying.\\n\\nKeep up the good work, hope to try more.\\n\\n**78/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky review #211, Japan review #32, Whisky Network review #998*\\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)',\n",

A simplistic google search will show that it is gold that flows from the Heavens, given to us by Kami-no-Kaze, sprinkled down into the minds of genius makers who truly have taken the reins from Scotland when it comes to Single Malt, and for some, whisky in the world in general.\\n\\nThe truth, it would seem, is far different than the above fiction which bubbles up from the taters of the world.\\n\\nToday I'll be reviewing **Akashi White Oak Blend**, a Japanese blend of grain and malt.

It's burnt caramel pain.\\n\\nIt's young, thus the finish is short.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Yeah, it's not a great whisky. At all. Mostly just burnt and off tasting. Not a fun dram to sip on.\\n\\nThat said, given some time, the nose ended up with some floral aspects, that I think could grow. The wood chip/vegetal notes were quite rough.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I expected more from this distillery.

You would be very hard pressed to nose this blind and pick it as a rye whisky. I actually don’t find the palate as sweet as I thought that it would be. It’s fruity, but not sweet. Some spice also makes appearance on the palate and finish to bring some much needed balance.

Where it really shined was when I took half an ounce and made the world’s smallest Manhattan (with Vya). THAT was damn good. But at $50 a bottle or so, I am not sure this is the best use of a rye. In fact, I will stick with Rittenhouse and Baby Saz for my Manhattans. I picked up a bottle of this last time I was in Kentucky. I will enjoy it, but I am not sure I need another.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Alberta Dark Batch (compliments of [/u/mikeczyz/](https://www.reddit.com/user/mikeczyz))**\\n\\n\\n**Specs:** 45% ABV; 91% rye, 8% bourbon, 1% sherry (the horror!)\\n\\n**Pour:** 2+ oz., neat, glencairn, rested a couple of minutes\\n\\n**Recently Un-pregnant Wife Superpower Nose:** “Kind of sweet.\" Then she fell back to sleep.\\n\\n**My Nose:** Varnish, weird fruits, medicinal, cloying sweetness\\n\\n**Taste:** Raisins. Lots and lots of raisins. Surprisingly gentle given the pungent chemical smell; mild spice; a vague sweetness, overall a taste of “meh” that improves slightly over time\\n\\n**Finish:** Short to the point of being almost non-existent\\n\\n**Overall:** 75. I wasn’t a huge fan of High West Midwinter’s Night Dram (score: 85), so I guess it is little surprise that I don’t care for this a lot.

After a moment I take my first sip, again, just looking for first impressions.\\n\\nI then let the glass sit for 10-15 minutes and come back for a more thoughtful examination.\\n\\n**Color:** [1.6 Mahogany](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg). Perfectly clear with no sediment.\\n\\n**First Impression:** Nose and palate both are hot, sweet, red fruit, and spice. *Almost* like a pre-made Manhattan cocktail. Lots of caramel. Lingering finish.\\n\\n**After 10 minutes:** The nose is full of a rich nuttiness, brown sugar, and hints of plum and cherry. Definite rye spice. Mouthfeel is creamy, with just enough heat to enjoy the ABV without it being overpowering or hot. Palate is rich with rye spice, an almond-like nuttiness, hardwood sawdust, caramelized sugar, a touch of vanilla, and a faint cherry cola bite.\\n\\n**Finish:** Finish lingers with rye spice fading to black pepper and then to an oaky astringency with burnt caramel. Very nice.\\n\\n**Overall:** This is a fun pour. I love a great Manhattan cocktail, and was looking for an inexpensive new rye to try, and YES, this **does** make an absolutely incredible Manhattan! 2:1 with Cocchi Torino, stirred cold, served up with a lemon twist and cherry garnish!\\n\\nBut, back to the whisky itself. It was unusual enough that I began doing some digging because I wanted to know more.

Approximately half of this is from pot still distillate aged 6 years in new oak. The other half is higher ABV column still distillate aged 12 years in used oak.\\n\\n- 8% Old Grand-Dad 4 year old 80 proof bourbon.\\n\\n- 1% Oloroso sherry from John Harvey & Sons\\n\\nI know “F—Beam” is a thing, but Beam Suntory has created a very unique Canadian Rye Whisky with this, and it is one I will keep around on my home bar.\\n\\n**Scoring:**\\n- First Impression: 82/100\\n- Nose: 85/100\\n- Palate: 87/100\\n- Finish: 82/100\\n\\n**Final Score: 84/100**\\n\\n**Scoring Interpretation:**\\n- **0-59:** What is this? Yuck! Is this a joke?! Did I lose a bet?!\\n\\n- **60-69:** Meh... glad I tried it so I have the palate experience, but I'm not gonna chase this down again.\\n\\n- **70-79:** Nothing to get overwrought about, but if the price is right, I'd drink this any time.\\n\\n- **80-89:** Fantastic! I want a bottle on my bar all the time.\\n\\n- **90-95:** Truly amazing. A special treat I will savor when I can.\\n\\n- **96-100:** Have yet to taste something I'd rate here.

       " 'Alberta Dark Batch is a Canadian blended rye whisky that became available in the states within the last year. Canadians will be much more familiar this product under its original name \"Dark Horse\" but due to an existing distiller in the United States already using that name Beam Suntory is offering it under a different label here. What is really interesting about Dark Batch to me is how it takes advantage of the more relaxed whisky regulations of our neighbors to the north. Chuck Cowdery has an [excellent writeup](http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2015/04/this-new-canadian-whisky-contains.html) that delves deeper into that subject but the TLDR; version is that Canadian whisky can contain a small percentage of spirits from other sources and doesn\\'t have to be aged in fresh charred barrels. Given that flexibility, what we end up with here is a blend of 45.5% Canadian rye whisky aged 6 years in fresh charred oak barrels, 45.5% Canadian rye whiskey aged 12 years in used bourbon barrels, 8% Old Grand-Dad (no age statement) bourbon, and 1% sherry. While all of that sounds exciting on paper, with so much going on there\\'s also there\\'s a chance it could be a complete mess.\\n\\n***\\n\\n####**Review #3: Alberta Dark Batch (Whisky Network Review #130)**\\n\\n*No Age Statement; 45% ABV; $28*\\n\\n**Nose:** Menthol, eucalyptus, red wine, brown sugar, pine. It\\'s spicy, sweet, and fruity as expected.  \\n\\n**Taste:** Tastes a lot like it smells. Menthol, pine, and anise spice are very noticeable even from the start of the palate. The spicy notes taper off a little in the middle to give way to some softer brown sugar and red wine fruity notes. The spice comes back stronger in the finish but I find things start to fall apart a bit at the end. The spice takes on sharper, more aggressive peppery characteristics which overpower some of the fruit and sweet notes I would expect to linger.\\n\\n**Thoughts:** I like it but it\\'s not for everyone and certainly not something I would want to reach for every day. At a recent [blind rye tasting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/3qn7n6/imaginary_internet_friends_blind_tasting_12_rye/) I participated in this took second place only to the very beloved Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye Cask Strength.  That\\'s not very surprising as there\\'s a lot to love about this. Judging purely on uniqueness this one ranks well and also scores a lot of points in the value department as sub $30 is a great price considering all of the individual components. I can\\'t help but to compare this to High West\\'s Midwinter Nights Dram which blows this out of the water but in the absence of that bottle Dark Batch is a nice affordable and accessible substitute.\\n\\n**Rating: B / B-**\\n\\nYou can find more of my reviews on my blog [signde drinks](http://signdedrinks.blogspot.com/2015/11/alberta-dark-batch-review.html).',\n",
       " \"**Canadian Whisky Review #10 - Alberta Rye Dark Batch**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIn my quest to achieve my Canadian flag flair, I've made some questionable choices (Canadian Club, anyone?). For this 10th Canadian whisky review, I had a few swap samples to choose from. I could have opted for either of two versions of Stalk & Barrel Small Batch, but I decided instead to go with a Canadian rye whisky worthy of the name. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAlberta Rye Dark Batch is a rye's rye, made up of an impressive 91% rye whisky. And the remaining 9% ups the ante, consisting of bourbon (8%) and sherry (1%). I'm not even sure how to qualify this. It's basically a blended whisky, although the sherry would keep it from bearing that designation anywhere but Canada, I suppose. Whatever it is, I'm excited to try it. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMany thanks to /u/ODMBitters for the sample, provided back in the halcyon days of /r/ScotchSwap (RIP).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ABV:** 45%\\n\\n**Source:** 2 oz bottle, received from /u/ODMBitters\\n\\n**Color:** 1.7 (Burnt umber)\\n\\n---\\n\\n* **Nose:** Pomegranate syrup.

Brown sugar caramel.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Short. Black pepper. Rye. Sherry.\\n \\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Overall impression:** I was really enjoying this as is but couldn't help thinking it would make a killer Manhattan. So after a much briefer than normal nosing and tasting, I poured the rest back in the bottle to use in a cocktail later on. Not overly complex, although the combination of rye, bourbon, and sherry definitely adds some interesting notes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Score:** 84/100\",\n",
       " \"So this is a blended rye by the Canadian giant Alberta distillers. I believe that this is a blended rye consisting of 91% pure rye whisky, 8% bourbon, and 1% sherry. The rye component is *supposedly* a blend of a 12 year high proof 100% rye blended with a 6 year low proof 100% rye. I heard interesting things about this as I heard rumors of people saying this is sort of similar to High West's Midwinter's Night Dram (since it's a rye finished in port & French oak, hence the sweet wine w/ a bit of spice from the French oak). Anyway...here we go...\\n\\n---\\n**Alberta Dark Batch** / 45% ABV\\n\\naka Alberta Dark Horse in places not in the US\\n\\n\\nNeat in a glencairn\\n\\n**Region:** Canadian\\n\\n**Chill-Filtration:** YES\\n\\n**Nose** - Definitely a heavy sherry influence here even though it's only 1% of the whisky, dark pitted fruits, vanilla caramels and milk chocolate are in the background. Sweet spiced plums stewed in a red wine.\\n\\n**Taste** - Sweet dark cherries, luxardo maraschino cherry syrup, rye bread, cinnamon, dark chocolate covered cherries, wild cherry pepsi concentrate.\\n\\n**Finish** - Lingering bitter walnut sweetness, more luxardo cherry syrup, a drying dark chocolate bittersweet.\\n\\n**89/100**\\n\\nPurchased: October of 2015 / 750mL / ~$32 USD purchased online\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is an interesting whisky that I think is quite tasty, but you have to be in the mood for it. It's a bit on the sweet side but it's got the rye spice to sorta tame it back just a tiny bit. I can see why some people might say this is similar to High West Midwinter's Night Dram, but I'd have to say this is a bit sweeter and not as refined. It's tasty but you can tell that there's a very heavy sherry influence. You can almost tell that it's more of a blend versus something that has been vatted in a sherry cask and has time to slowly absorb and mingle the flavors. The added sherry in this one is almost overpowering, but it mixes well. I can definitely see this as being more of a dessert whisky or something to make a sweeter cocktail with. Maybe a dessert old fashioned using chocolate bitters and orange bitters with maple syrup instead of simple.\",\n",
       " 'Between the plain label, the unoriginal name, the lack of an age statement, and the price tag, you might be forgiven for thinking that Alberta Premium Canadian Rye Whisky is bottom-of-the-barrel sludge whisky. But you’d be wrong (apparently)—this stuff earned the designation of ‘Canadian whisky of the year’ by Jim Murray five out of the last seven years. What makes it special? Well, despite the fact that people usually call Canadian whisky ‘rye’, Alberta Distillers Ltd., who make this stuff, are actually one of only two Canadian whisky-makers left that actually use a 100% rye mash-bill in their whiskies (the others long ago switched to corn and lighter grains). Alberta Premium is the standard bottling, but there’s a 10 year old (Alberta Springs), a high-proof version (Dark Horse), and periodic one-off releases of 25- and 30-year-old variants that sell for disturbingly tiny sums (we’re talking $55 Cdn. for a 30 year old Alberta Premium).\\n\\nThe brand, as I understand it, is owned by Jim Beam. But here’s the rub—they’ve decided (thus far) not to distribute it outside of Canada. Which is a shame, because as it turns out it’s not all hype: this is as good, or nearly as good, as a standard entry-level Canadian whisky gets.\\n\\nAlberta Premium Canadian Rye Whisky; 40% ABV; No age statement, but promotional material says that this stuff gets 5 years in the racks; goes for about $22 Cdn. (making it $4-5 less than its big name competitors).\\n\\n**Appearance:** Approaching amber? Which, considering its age, is no doubt the result of caramel colouring. Surprising legs for a young, 40% ABV whisky, though.\\n\\n**Nose:** At first, your standard Canadian whisky nosing notes: vanilla, toffee, maple syrup. Oaky. But better integrated than the maple-vanilla oak bombs of other Canadian whiskies. It’s a lot more . . . natural, if that makes sense? And the alcohol is surprisingly muted for a 5 year old bottling, and the rye spiciness is there in the background. A farm field in fall, and some cereal drift in and out, but they’re so ephemeral it’s hard to say I’m not imagining things. Distant grass. Light fruits—berries, especially. Honey. Water doesn’t seem to have much of an effect, save for perhaps bringing out a bit more of the rye spice. Slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so in the manner of other Canadian whiskies.\\n\\n**Taste:** Exceptionally smooth for a 5 year old whisky. There’s still a bit of fire there, but it’s much more subdued than the burn that accompanies the standard Canadian whisky offerings (Canadian Club, Crown Royal, even the 12 Year Old Wiser’s). The rye is a lot more apparent on the palate. Spicy grain mingle with vanilla and maple oak. Honey. Again, slightly sweet, but with enough spicy and woody dryness to offer some balance. Give it some time, and there’s actually a bit of berried sweetness. Not complex by any means, but balanced, smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n**Finish:** Short. Some spicy rye and vanilla, but this stuff is clearly manufactured for smoothness (and more power to it for that). Nice balance of sweet and spice.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** I can’t say that I ever really see myself sipping this stuff, but it’s enjoyable, and it’s absolutely worth giving credit where credit’s due by acknowledging that Alberta Premium is miles ahead of the standard big-name Canadian whisky bottling. It outshines CC, Crown Royal, and Wiser’s—and does so for about $5 less per bottle. I’ll probably enjoy it on the rocks (is that sacrilegious to say here?) just because that’s how I grew up drinking Canadian whisky, but this stuff really does hold its own neat—better than it has any right to, anyway. Not complex, but smooth and offers a well-integrated overview of the typical Canadian whisky taste notes (with just a little extra spicy rye thrown in for good measure). Cheap enough that it’s absolutely worth a try if you can find it, but it’s a shame that Beam has decided not to export it for international markets—because it represents the potential of a (usually much-maligned) style of whisky much better than the brand-name titans.\\n\\n**Score:** 81',\n",
       " \"###**Alberta Premium Rye -  40% ABV**\\n\\none of the first canadian whiskies I had years ago, didn't really appreciate it at the time… it was cheap and simple and I mixed it with gingerale. I've had a bottle at the back of my shelf for a while and pulled it out to send out a sample in a swap. thought i'd give it a proper reckoning here! one of the only 100% rye whisky makers in Canada (more are coming up now with the whisky boom), AP's Dark Horse offering is much admired, though this one seems to get a bad rap. very curious to see how i feel about it after a long time drinking scotch and bourbons\\n\\n**Appearance:**  amber-orange, some real staying power on the glass. I normally don't comment on packaging, but there's something classic about the bottle… it looks like a decanter and reminds me of my grandfather. Might be part of why it's less popular with young folks, but i can see a hipster crowd getting into it\\n\\n**Nose:** really hot on the nose.. You can smell how young it is. Lots of maple syrup, sugar, vanilla oak, rye spiciness\\n\\n**Taste:** maple to the fore, not as hot as the aroma, burnt sugar, spicy rye, honey, more maple syrup, honey\\n\\n**Finish:** hot and spicy. Lasts a while, but the intensity drops off quickly. \\n\\n**Rating: 77/100**\\n\\nso definitely not as good as the dark horse. Lots of potential here and I'll be keeping my eyes on the distillery for another one of their 25-30 year releases (at $55 for a 30-yr, it's insane!). I might have to pick up the Alberta Springs 10 yr version, as this could definitely benefit from some aging. tasty and very spicy which is nice. at the price, it's good value, but i'd sooner spend the few bucks more for Dark Horse. \",\n",
       " '# The Great Blind Rye-Off: Reviews 2-13\\n\\n“*Twelve ryes enter. Twelve ryes leave... but in ranked order, after being tasted blind.*”\\n\\n ___\\n\\n**Background**: I have a secret to admit. For many years, I was a fan of Jim Murray. I would buy the *Bible* annually, and keep an eye-out for Jim’s highly-rated bottles. Though he had let me astray a few times (Ballentine’s 17 - what was he thinking?!), by and large his tastes seemed to align with my own. And it was super handy to have a little pocket sized book I could bring to the LCBO (the Government-monopoly store here in Ontario) or on trips abroad to guide my purchases and avoid (some) mediocrity.\\n\\nThen, in 2015, Murray awarded his top honours - and top marks - to Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye. Many were incredulous. It didn’t take me long to find a bottle (an initial rush depleted stock, but it was soon easy to find). Did it live up to the hype? Well... it was good... but.... the best?\\n\\nSince then, many have held the selection as proof that Murray has lost his wits - or been paid off. Though I’m no longer a follower of Murray, I’ve long wondered whether, in a blind test, Northern Harvest Rye would prove itself the masterpiece Murray thinks it is. Thus, the experiment.\\n\\n___\\n\\n**The Experiment:** I assembled all the ryes I had on hand, and picked up a few more they had in stock at the LCBO. Unfortunately, several frequently-recommended bottles I see here weren’t available, such as Willet, Midsummer Night’s Dram, Old Forester, Michter’s, Rare Breed Rye, or this year’s Murray-pick, Alberta Premium Cask Strength. They will have to wait. In the end, I had 6 Canadian and 6 U.S. Ryes, mostly from the lower end of the pricing spectrum.\\n\\nMy wife randomly assigned a letter to each bottle. The first round was tasted in two batch (A-F and G-L, respectively). I took tasting notes and selected 3 winners from each batch (A, B, D and G, J, K) . A run-off was held between D, G, H, I, and L because it was initially a bit too close to call. A final tasting of the winners was held, with the winners ranked. The bottom six were ranked on my existing notes (i.e. not retasted a second or third time).\\n\\n___\\n\\n## The Results: \\n(*Note: See also my rating scale at the bottom of this post. By design, it does not have a lot of granularity. Even though I’ve ranked what I tasted according to preference, to the extent two bottles share the same rating, you can assume that they’re roughly equivalent in quality*).\\n\\n**First Place - (B)** >!**Knob Creek Cask Strength (Batch 2, 2010)** (C$101.40 for 750ml; 63.5% abv; rye content not disclosed but reported to be around 51%).!< **Nose:** Pickle, peanuts, leather. **Taste:** Strong honey and leather, underlying dried fruit. **Finish**: Long, well balanced. **Afternose:** The sweet fruit note grows and grows. **Conclusion**: Perhaps a bit of an unfair fight since this was the the most expensive bottle with the highest abv and among the lowest rye content. Very enjoyable. It was the best, but it also wasn’t a standout winner over second and third place. I travelled across town to pick this one up, and would do so again. **Rating:** ❁\\n\\n**Second Place - (A)** >!**Sazerac Straight Rye Whiskey** (C$59.75 for 750ml; 45% abv; rye content not disclosed but reported to be around 51%).!< **Nose:** Bright pickles and sweet pear. **Taste:** Soft pear, oak, sweet spices, and leather. **Finish**: Long, well balanced between sweet and oaky bitterness. **Afternose:** Stewed apples and maple syrup. **Conclusion**: Another lower rye whiskey, and the third most expensive of what I’ve tried. Honestly not one I would have ranked as highly pre-blind, but its clearly very good. I now really want to try Thomas H. Handy, as I can imagine how upping the proof on this will result in something spectacular. **Rating:** ❁\\n\\n**Third Place - (D)** >!**Bulleit 95 Rye** (C$41.00 for 750ml; 45% abv; 95% rye).!< **Nose:** Light pickle and red delicious apple. **Taste:** Oak, vanilla, light spices. **Finish**: Very long and well balanced. **Afternose:** Sweet floral candy. Interesting and pleasant! **Conclusion**: I’ve always liked Bulleit 95, but am frankly surprised it made it this high. Nevertheless, this was really  enjoyable, so here we are. It’s also the first truly high-content rye on the list, which deserved a bonus point or something (none awarded). **Rating:** ❁\\n\\n**Tied for Fourth Place - (K)** >!**Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye** (C$35.95 for 750ml; 45% abv; 95% rye).!< **Nose:** Candied apples, flowers. **Taste:** Pickles, apples, vanilla. Noticeably softer than any of the above entries. **Finish**: The pickles subside and the vanilla grows. **Afternose:** Floral candy, again.  **Conclusion**: So, here we are. This was good but a noticeable drop from the first three. Very drinkable, but lacking some oomph. Bringing it up to 100 proof would probably help.  In any event, this is far more readily available in Ontario than either Bulleit or Sazerac Rye, which means that I will keep buying it. **Rating:** ☻\\n\\n**Tied for Fourth Place - (J)** >!**JP Wiser’s Triple Barrel Rye** (C$32.95 for 750ml; 45% abv;  rye content not disclosed but reported to be around 62%).!< **Nose:** Red wine. Tannic fresh fruit, cherries and strawberries, lightly floral hints, honey, and black pepper. This is eerily similar to a merlot.  **Taste:** Sweet peaches, oak, vanilla. **Finish**: Oak and vanilla, balanced. **Afternose:** Apricots and honey - very nice. **Conclusion**: I’d never had this before and have seen relatively few reviews, but it’s definitely a winner. Very drinkable, with a rather unique flavour profile. **Rating:** ☻\\n\\n**Sixth Place - (G)** >!**Pikesville Rye, Aged 6 Years** (C$90.10 for 750ml; 55% abv;  rye content not disclosed but reported to be around 51%).!< **Nose:** Grass, pickles, cherries, tobacco. “Dusty”. **Taste:** Hot and semi-sweet. Lots of wood mixed with leather, the dustiness persists. **Finish**: Long, slightly sweet as caramel comes through. **Afternose:**Surprisingly weak. Just a bit of sweet fruit. **Conclusion**: I thought this might end up a bit higher, given it’s the second most expensive bottle, but I had mixed feelings about the dust note. It was good, but not something I expect to replace once gone. Jim Murray also gave this a 97.5, for whatever that’s worth. This is the premium, aged version of Rittenhouse Rye (see next). **Rating:** ☻\\n\\n___\\n\\n**Rating Key**\\n\\n-\\t❁❁❁: A masterpiece. One of the finest whiskies I’ve ever had. I would go to great lengths to find another bottle. (An 8+ on the t8ke scale).\\n-\\t❁❁: Excellent. I would go to considerable lengths for a bottle.

And given the love for Albertan water and wheat, why not?\\n\\nHowever, maybe I should explain why that\\'s significant: Alberta is part of the Prairie Provinces in Canada, meaning that they are generally known for growing all the wheat (or at least most of it, I don\\'t know the percentages and someone will show up and yell at me if I pretend to). Granted Alberta is also known for the Stampede (big rodeo fun times), amazing Beef, right wing politics, being ignored by the country because we\\'re dumb, oil, and actually turning a profit.\\n\\nIt\\'s a nice place. The water is a different story. If you ever see the water in Northern Alberta, you\\'ll be blown away. Iceberg water is a distinct, clean blue that shines without direct sunlight.

       " '# Reviews #14 and 15 - Alberta Premium 20 YO and Cask Strength\\n\\nAlberta Premium is a Canadian Distillery, founded in 1946, located in Calgary, Alberta, and now owned by the Suntory Beam conglomerate. It comes in a distinctive 70s-esque geometric decanter-style bottle, which [has actually been around since at least the 1970s](https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1975/6/1/it-doesnt-help-to-be-jewish-in-manitoba). Its claim to fame is being featured as the whisky of choice for the fine folks in Trailer Park Boys and also having controversially  snagged Jim Murray’s choice for top whisky of the year with its Cask Strength edition ([and then promptly distancing itself from that award](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/whisky-jim-murray-bible-sexist-calgary-distillery-1.5735292)).\\n \\nRecently I was able to obtain bottles of both the Cask Strength and 20 YO editions, and I had previously reviewed the standard version of Alberta Premium as part of my [blind 12 rye roundup](https://reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/jgbld1/the_great_blind_ryeoff_reviews_213/) on /r/bourbon. I tried all three side-by-side (plus another tasting of just the 20 YO and CS), and include my mostly enjoyed on the standard edition below.\\n\\n## Alberta Premium (standard)\\n___\\n\\n\\t•\\tNo age statement, 40% alc./vol., 750ml bottle\\n\\t•\\t100% rye grain\\n\\t•\\t$27.75 CAD\\n___\\n\\n**Nose:** As before, burnt marshmallows, crackers, and dust.\\n\\n**Taste:** As before, sweet but very light. There’s barely any flavour here.\\n\\n**Finish:** I said the finish was long before, but I think I may have accidentally copied the note from Lot 40. This was medium-short and still with very little flavour.\\n\\n**Afternose:** (I enjoy nosing the glass after its empty, as its own olfactory experience.  Since it counts toward my enjoyment, it counts toward my score) As before, weak with prunes and honey.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This remains thoroughly underwhelming. It is extremely cheap, but spending a few dollars more will get you a lot better.\\n\\n**Score:** No rating / not recommended. \\n\\n## Alberta Premium 20 Year Old\\n___\\n\\n\\t•\\t20 years old, 42% alc./vol., 750ml bottle\\n\\t•\\t100% rye grain\\n\\t•\\t$74.99 CAD\\n___\\n\\n**Nose:** The same burnt marshmallow, but slightly stronger. However, there’s also a distinct acetone note that just will not go away.\\n\\n**Taste:** Semi-sweet. It’s still very light in the mouth. There are whispers of raisin, pine, caramel and rye grain, but this is only marginally more interesting than the standard edition.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium. There’s a bit of rye grain, mild oak. Inoffensive but also unremarkable.\\n\\n**Afternose:** Also mild. Semi-sweet sugars and oak.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** What a bummer. This is better than the standard version, but not by much. I recall seeing another reviewer mention that the distiller uses column stills that pull out most of the flavour, so perhaps its unsurprising that even after 20 years there’s not much interesting going on. If this was $28, I would still have trouble recommending it. At three times that it’s an easy pass.\\n\\n**Score:** No rating / not recommended.\\n\\n## Alberta Premium Cask Strength\\n___\\n\\n\\t•\\tNo age statement, 65.1% alc./vol., 750ml bottle\\n\\t•\\t100% rye grain\\n\\t•\\t$64.75 CAD\\n___\\n\\n**Nose:** Woah. Woah woah woah. A chocolate bomb! Creamy milk chocolate that just pulls you in, followed by subtle grain and fruit notes. Very, very nice.\\n\\n**Taste:** Rich and mouth-coating. There’s rye, caramel, chocolate, cherries, oak. It’s good, but becomes muddled somewhat quicker than I would hope.\\n\\n**Finish:** Long and balanced between oak and brown sugar. Pleasant, if a bit simple.\\n\\n**Afternose:** Dried plums mixed with chocolate malt. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Now this is more like it. It’s got a fantastic nose, loads of unique flavour, and is eminently enjoyable. I can’t believe it’s the same juice as in the other bottles because this actually tastes like something. I even prefer this over the winner of my rye-off, Knob Creek Cask Strength, if only just. And this is $35 cheaper! It’s at the cusp of 2 stars, and I’m sincerely hoping future versions will be able to deliver just a bit more complexity on the palate to push it over the edge.\\n\\n**Score:** ❁\\n\\n___\\n\\n**Rating Key**\\n\\n-\\t❁❁❁: A masterpiece.

       " \"Hey all, sorry for not posting for a week. Had a 30th birthday one week, and my 4th anniversary this weekend, so I needed to take a week from doing reviews to ensure I didn't end up floating.\\n\\nWhile out in the Collingwood area, my wife and I discovered a new, amazing, **700+ whisky pub.** [The Dam Pub](http://www.thedampub.ca/) is an amazing, tasty, well mannered, and amazing. Seriously, it's up there with The Feather's Pub, and you know how much I gush about that place. If you are in the Collingwood area, and like whisky even a little bit, that's where you need to go.\\n\\nUnfortunately... I run into an issue. The same issue we face on a regular basis.  \\n\\nPop Quiz hotshot. You have 700 choices. You know you're maximum amount of nips/drams until you can no longer review anything else. You've only reviewed about 200 different whiskies. What do you do? What do you do?\\n\\nWell... you have to triage your reviews and pick out the hard to find ones.\\n\\nUp first, we have **Alberta Premium 25 year**. Released 7 years ago, this rye is, to say the least, hard to find. A small batch launched by a large distiller is normally not easy to find, as it was probably released as a one off. Not to mention the taxes involved ups the price.\\n\\nAlso: What if after years of being in the cask, the 100% rye isn't that great? Thus they sold it off for $30.00 a bottle, and it ended up being a curiosity.\\n\\nLet's see if it challenges their current champ, Dark Horse.\\n\\n**Price:** No longer available in stores\\n\\n**Region:** Canadian\\n\\n**Abv:** 40%\\n\\n**Colour:** Wheat\\n\\n**Nose:** Corn, butterscotch, cinnamon, underripe melon\\n\\nInteresting nose, however.. well, it's very, very light, especially for a rye. Like, scary, feather light weight. \\n\\nSome fruit, far off, somewhere still in Alberta. Which is too bad, as if it was stronger, I could nose this for a long time. Longer than I did.\\n\\nNot typical to a rye, more so really sweet, yet it's missing that overall Oomph.\\n\\n**Taste:** Caramel, salt, cayenne, cumin, floral, bubblegum\\n\\nThe flavour though? Damn, this is a tasty, tasty dram. Lots of spice, some floral and sweetness. More complex than a traditional Canadian whisky. I'm guessing 25 years really amps up the flavours, and the people at Alberta Premium knew what they were doing.\\n\\n**Finish:** Floral, cinnamon & nutmeg, honey, strawberry, wheat, plum\\n\\nWow. That finish. Just, like, cinnamon honey eaten out on the porch in the garden on fresh rye bread. And if you haven't done that yet, you're not living life like a suburbanite New Englander, and for that, I pity you sir.\\n\\nIf you don't like sweet whisky, you won't like the finish. But the floral and spice notes may save you.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The floral notes are what really sells this one. Well, that and being able to find it in a pub in Collingwood. Seriously though, there are issues that don't make it the perfect Canuck dram, and that issue is the nose. I'm guessing the low Abv. has stolen a lot of the nice, complex notes on this one.\\n\\nGlad they learned from this and made the Dark Horse a higher Abv. \\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n*Canadian review #21, World Whisky review #43*\\n\\n*Other Alberta Premium reviews:*\\n\\n* [Alberta Premium Dark Horse](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1478ih/alberta_premium_dark_horse_review/)\\n\\n* [Alberta Springs](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1rhtkq/alberta_springs_review/)\",\n",

       " 'Hi there, ~~ya hosers~~ r/WorldWhisky! Thanks to my buddy u/Angribear1 for pouring me this dram!\\n\\nAt long last, I’ve reached 10 Canadian whiskies reviewed. You’d think it wouldn’t take me this long, seeing as I live in Canada and all that. To tell you the truth, most Canadian whiskies just aren’t all that interesting to me. This one is definitely not one of those, however. Alberta Premium is pretty widely-available as a bargain-basement bar rail rye up in these parts. Their good barrels aren’t nearly so widespread, as they mostly get sold to the US rather than bottled for the domestic market. This release showed up last year as a bit of an exciting surprise, then. Let’s see how it is!\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Alberta Premium Cask Strength.** Canadian rye whisky. 65.1% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Local Price:** $65 CAD in Ontario.\\n\\n**Barrels:**  No age statement. 100% rye, distilled in pot stills. Bottled in 2019 at cask strength.\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 10 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Colour:** Dark gold.\\n\\n**Nose:** Sweet, herbal, savoury, and intense. Plenty of tart pickles and sourdough. Sweet notes of peaches, brown sugar, banana, coconut, pineapple, and vanilla. Black pepper, star anise, mustard seed, and eucalyptus. A bit of hot dog water.\\n\\n**Palate:** Medium texture. The heat isn’t quite as intense as I expected, but that might be due to my sample sitting around a little while. It definitely still packs a punch. Lots of tart, herbal rye up front, along with lemon juice, capers, banana cream pie, and sourdough. Some sweet notes in of toffee and vanilla, but counterbalanced by the spicy, herbal, slightly piney rye flavours. Some orange juice concentrate, green peas, and cloves on the back end.\\n\\n**Finish:** Big. Sourdough crusts, honey, orange, brown sugar, pecans, toasted marshmallows, and cane sugar cola. \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Notes:** This isn’t really my jam, but it’s a nice whisky for sure. Plenty of those big rye flavours if you’re into that sort of thing. A sweet and spicy flavour bomb. It drinks quite comfortably neat, too. I don’t think I can really compare it to much, since my rye experience is quite limited. I think I prefer the Lot 40 Cask Strengths that I’ve had to this, but this is still quite solid.\\n\\n\\n**Final score:  76/100**\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.\\n\\n60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good. Well above average.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout malt.\\n\\n90-94: Personal favourite.\\n\\n95-100: Mythical. I don’t know if I’ll ever taste a whisky this good.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAverage rating: 81.6\\n\\n*My rating scale is based purely on flavour experience, and does not take value-for-money or willingness to purchase a bottle into account.

       " 'Thanks to /u/devoz for sharing this dram with me.\\n\\nAlberta is currently a hot topic in Canada. There’s some history there which I won’t be getting into. I won’t be opening that particular can of worms here.\\n\\nThat said, it is the origin and part of the name of the whisky I’ll be reviewing today, **Alberta Premium Cask Strength**.\\n\\nI’m always a bit conflicted when it comes to Alberta Premium. They make rye, but it’s through a column still a lot of the time and a good amount of the flavour is pulled out. They can make some nice barrels of whisky, some interesting ones in Canada, but those get sold off across the US or don’t do well enough in our market. I love what they did with Dark Horse, but it’s been delisted now to make room for more profitable parts.\\n\\nI guess what I’m saying is I’m annoyed at capitalism enough for what it forces a company like Alberta Premium to do. However every so often they give something to the fans. This year we got a cask strength version.\\n\\nBut how does it taste? Is it worth my whinging? Let’s see, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** $64.95 CAD\\n\\n**Region:** Canada\\n\\n**Bottled:** 2019\\n\\n**Cask type:** Charred Oak\\n\\n**Abv:** 65.1%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10YR 7/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Vanilla, caramel, spice-heavy peach pie, rye spices\\n\\nNice strong vanilla, some caramel… I like this. It’s not going to that maple, super sweet level like Canadian whisky, more a sweeter American level. I guess that sucks if you aren’t a sweets fan.\\n\\nTons of butter, and a bunch of spices. The spice really does take over. It’s almost like they left in some of the key flavours of the grain this time. Thank goodness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Peach, cinnamon, play-doh, peanut, green grapes\\n\\nYeah, we all discussed the play-doh note over and over. I don’t know, it’s just something sitting there, but the inner 5-year-old in me is totally happy with it. Maybe my next whisky can have some paste notes to really round out those days of Kindergarten.\\n\\nJoking aside this is a strongly flavoured dram. Each note is distinct and right there, in your face. Which usually you only get if you’re a doctor in Alberta and you disagree with a leader’s wife’s Facebook post.\\n\\n**Finish:** Cereal, papaya, turnip, dill, oak\\n\\nThe finish is a bit raw compared to the taste and nose. That said the tropical note is quite nice, and the dill aspect really punches up. I’d say the turnip is there to distract you from some of the raw elements, like running a candidate to be a jerk in a political race.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Spice. More spice. And rocket fuel. This is a barn-burning strong dram. There’s nothing subtle, nothing quiet, nothing hiding anywhere. Big, bold flavours that punch you in the face quite hard.\\n\\nI gotta say I like this side of Canadian whisky. Gone are the cereal driven, subtle, maple-enwrapped notes compared to a strong, caramel/sweet peach-pie dram, I’ll take peach-pie. Heck, I haven’t had something this nice since the first cask strength Lot 40 (official release). Good. Let’s have more of these.

       " '***\\n\\n**Alberta Premium Cask Strength Rye**\\n\\n(65.1%, 100% rye, bottled 2019, region: Canada)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThanks to u/Devoz for this one!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:** Peach, brown sugar, cinnamon, clove, vanilla\\n\\n**Taste:** Peach, caramel, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, oak\\n\\n**Finish:** Vanilla, cinnamon, clove, dill\\n\\n&nbsp; \\n\\nSweet and juicy fruit notes immediately, matched in intensity by the developing rye spices behind that. As that starts to air out, a bit of underlying wood comes out on the back end. More of the same sweet and spicy flavours and progression on the palate. The notes are drier in the mouth and the spices pack a bite as well, as things build more tannic leading into the finish with a light woody bitterness. Dry with a ton of rye spice. Mild vanilla sweetness lingers. \\n\\nIt’s a brash experience, sweet, dry and spicy to varying degrees throughout. Straightforward rye flavours, which in Canadian whisky terms means it achieves something quite rare and does it quite well (read: no weird/grainy off notes). A bit of water tames the spice, but also dulls the rest proportionally. As far as Canadian ryes go, I’d slot this as slightly better than regular Lot 40, though for my personal taste I have still preferred the additional complexities of the past couple Lot 40 CS more. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n85/100\\n\\n***',\n",

It's an incredibly interesting nose. There's something I'm having trouble identifying in the nose that the bottle might be calling sweet oak or blackcurrant. But I'm calling it fresh rain as it seems to me like a sort of floral green vegetal note. It's honestly one of the most intersting whiskies I've ever nosed. \\n\\n**Taste:** Sweet Spicy and above all interesting. There are notes of butterscotch, young oak, fresh rye, maybe fresh hay even. It's delicious and complex\\n\\n**Mouthfeel:** Thick and full.\\n\\n**Finish:** longish with some beautiful clean rye spice notes hanging  out in the back of your mouth. \\n\\n**Verdict:** Wow, I've passed this one in the liquor store a few times because how good could a 29 dollar bottle be and the answer is pretty fantastic. This is a really great whisky and an absolute steal for its price. At this point I'm just raving and not really saying anything productive.\\n\\n**Rating:** 85\",\n",
       " \"**Alberta Premium Dark Horse**  Canadian Whisky (45%ABV)\\n\\nMy first whisky review. Here it is. I picked my oldest bottle and finished it off. Not only am I familiar with the bottle, but finishing it leaves a space in the cabinet for a new bottle!  \\n\\n\\n\\nI bought this bottle about six years ago --the same week that I bought my car. Indeed, I bought it at the SLGA outlet right next door to the car dealership. Now if that's not city planning, I don't know what is. So kudos to you, Warman, Saskatchewan. Kudos. Happily, my car lasted longer than the bottle, but the fact it lasted 6 years should tell you something. This was always an occasional drink for me.\\n\\n\\nEnough history, though. Back to today. \\n\\nI've got all the windows closed in my house, so it's a little stuffy. It's been surprisingly warm this October, reaching 22^o C today. But the wind picked up this evening, and they're calling for winds of 70 to 100 km/h for most of the province. So I sit in my stuffy house, listening to my refrigerator hum, typing this review intro while gazing deeply into my drink. \\n\\nThe bottle's empty; the glass is full. Time to go.\\n\\n*Tasted in a glencairn after resting for however long it took me to take a photo and write this much of the post.*\\n\\n**Appearance**: Amber in colour, like a tea that has been steeping a little longer than to my taste. Legs are longer lasting than I'd expect, but then again, I have usually already sipped the stuff before.  \\n\\n**Nose**: red grapes, vanilla, and a sour note that I can't quite place.\\n\\n**Taste**: A fruit wine or port. It has a fortified taste to it. It definitely has a rye spice to it, but I find it takes a back seat to the fruitiness, again like red grapes or currants. \\n\\n**Finish**: Very sweet, like maple syrup. Not a lot of heat. The sides of my tongue tingle like I ate Hot Tamales about 30 minutes ago and haven't had anything in my mouth since. Not the taste, mind you, but the sensation. \\n\\n**Conclusion**: This bottle has some history for me, as discussed above. I like it, especially in a boulevardier. It's very sweet, and takes the Campari like a champ. But in the lifetime since I bought the bottle, my tastes have changed somewhat. At ~$30CAD for a bottle here in Saskatchewan, I probably will pick up another bottle, but it's not going to be a priority. \\n\\n**79/100** -- Enjoyable, but not something I'd want every day, and not something I'd go out of my way for.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"**Alberta Premium Dark Horse 750ml 45%**\\n\\nCan I just start off by saying that I really don't understand the prices for whisky in Canada. It can't just be tax or import costs, can it? \\n\\nAnyways, anyone living in Japan has to appreciate how absolutely spoiled they are when it comes to prices for whisky product. I had a mild appreciation in Tokyo but now that I'm here in Vancouver, I absolutely understand and appreciate how much I was saving.\\n\\nSo of course, here I am in Vancouver. Seems fitting that I should be getting to know Canadian whiskies better. I liked the Canadian Club Sherry Cask offerings and I was told that the Alberta Premium Dark Horse was a good offering as well. So I picked up a bottle last week and here I am with my report, such as it is. \\n\\n**Nose:** The nose is very sweet with clear grapes, vanilla oak, and fruit notes. Very mild on the nose. \\n\\n**Taste:** PORT! Wine? Interesting. The first thing I thought of was port. The fruitiness is there but along comes a big port splash with the heat of whisky. It's good although after multiple sips, it's reminding me of port a bit too much. Very sweet. Again very fruity and easy to handle for even the most beginner of whisky drinkers. \\n\\nI should say here that I love Laphroaig and the peated Islay Scotches so while I recognize this is a fine product, it's not that interesting for me. \\n\\n**Finish:** Medium finish. It's nice. \\n\\n**Overall score:** 80/100\\nFor the price, $35 dollars here in Vancouver, it's worth it. It's a nice whisky for sure and easy to drink. Simply because of my tastes in whisky, I'd probably want to go with something else first before I bought this again, but I do think it's a fine whisky and a good overall product. \",\n",
       " '**Specifics**: $29.95 750mL, 45% ABV\\n\\n**First Impressions**: Bottle is very nice. Stout and round, simple black band label. Looks and feels expensive and weighty. The presentation demands you take the product seriously.\\n\\n**Nose**: Spice, rye, coffee (slightly burnt), jam (strawberry), moist chocolate cake, slight ethanol around the edges, dark fruit, heavy fruit cake, candied cherries. After sitting 10m, strong maple syrup.\\n\\n**Taste**: Starts off with a quick burst of rye, spice and sweet mixed with dark, pitted fruits (cherries, plum). Transitions quickly into chocolate cake and strawberry (the middle part of a black forest cake). Robust and filling. Decadent. The finish is hot, white pepper, rye, astringent, dry (wine), camphor plays peek-a-boo. Nice and long. \\n\\n**Comparisons**: Far more complex than Double Barrel Reserve from 40 Creek which is extremely basic and “meh” when pitted against this dram. Easily competes with the best of the 40 Creek Premium offerings, which means this is simply one of the best Canadian whiskies out there. At $30 there is simply no reason not to have this on your shelf compared to the $60-70 you will pay for anything comparable from 40 Creek. I am very pleased with the regular Alberta Premium and exceptionally pleased with Dark Horse. If the quality continues and AP branches into the States expect this dram to attain legendary status and renew interest in Canadian offerings.\\n\\n**Score**: Complex, substantial, and well balanced. What more could you ask for in a dram? At $30 for 750mL, it’s a steal! They could triple the price and it would still be a considerable value compared to other bottling available in Ontario, for both Canadian and Scotch whiskies, and that’s why I am giving Dark Horse \\n\\n**94/100**\\n\\n[edit] Score probably seems high, and it is. Especially when one considers things like Highland Park 12, or Lagavulin 16 exist. And it\\'s true, if I was rating Scotch this wouldn\\'t be a 94-score drink. My score is based on \"like\", and compared to the Canadian Whisky/Rye market I this is one of the best drinks available, imo.',\n",

I promised myself I'd review more world whisky samples in the near future, so here's another quality Canadian whiskey sample from /u/TOModera. \\n\\nThis one is Alberta Premium Dark Horse - a whiskey I know literally nothing about except that you dudes seem to rave about it. Does that correlate with quality?\\n\\nLet's find out!\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Alberta Premium Dark Horse**  \\n*Canadian Rye, 45% ABV, NCF?, E150?, 50ml sample from /u/TOModera*\\n\\n**Nose**: Rich orange. Rye. Dark caramel. Raspberry. Dry rye bread. Dry earth. \\n\\nNot as rough as the Lot 40 on the nose, but having a hard time pulling much out of it. I think a bit of air and time is required to open it up. Definitely opens up with time and becomes earthier and mustier.\\n\\n**Taste**: Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Creamy rye. Ripe orange. Earthy dry rye bread. Raspberry. Caramel and butterscotch. Light artificial corn. \\n\\nI think raspberry and orange are my go-to descriptors for rye whiskey, and this has them in spades. It's really very excellent, but not quite as wowing as the Lot 40, but far more consistent with the nose. \\n\\n**Finish**: Medium length. Rich and sweet. Dark caramel and burnt sugar. Orange and orange zest. Earthy oak. \\n\\nGood, strong finish - perhaps a touch short. No real development, but still very good. \\n\\n**Summary**: This is really good, actually. I'm starting to find that rye whiskey definitely suits my palate more than corn whiskey, and the Canadian ryes that TOModera sent me are definitely suiting me well. \\n\\nThis is a much earthier rye than most I've tried, and I'm really enjoying that type of profile. That's not to say that this isn't sweet - it is, but the earthiness brings another dimension to it and keeps it from being cloying. \\n\\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed this. Thank you TOModera!

The word Hibiki roughly translates to resonance in Japanese, per Suntory’s website. Thanks to /u/Ethenolas for the sample.\\n\\n43% abv\\n\\n**Nose** - Rather muted at first– Honey, brown sugar, maybe some plums (the plum note is hardly surprising, as this is partly aged in plum liqueur casks per The Whisky Exchange). Some breathing brings some spice – cinnamon, clove, and maybe some allspice to the party, along with some walnuts.\\n\\n**Taste** - Very light. Honey, brown sugar, walnuts, a slightly creamy vanilla note, a bit of drying oak, and apple juice. A bit of spice sneaks in as well – cinnamon, with maybe a little pepper. Very light body, almost watery.\\n\\n**Finish** -  A bit of apple juice, brown sugar and cinnamon linger a bit, but not in a big way.\\n\\nThis is very easy drinking. It’s light, somewhat fruity, and sweet – Suntory’s way of reaching out to the Scotch Blend drinker. It’s certainly enjoyable enough , but a bit too easygoing for my taste, as I tend to go for bigger flavors than this. However, if you like subtle flavors or smooth, easygoing whisky this is one for you.\\n\\n**84**/100\\n\\n**Alberta Premium Dark Horse**\\n\\nThanks to /u/TOModera for the sample. This is a rye whisky made by Alberta Distillers, which is a Beam Suntory company. Aged 5 years per their website.\\n\\n45% abv\\n\\n**Nose** - Rye makes its presence felt right away. Clove, anise, charred wood,  caramel-apple lollipops, nutmeg, allspice, black pepper, pleather car seats, celery seed. Interesting, and more earthy than your standard run of the mill rye. I like.\\n\\n**Taste** - Lighter feel than I expected from the nose, and less punchy. Caramel apple lollipop again, clove, allspice, black pepper, and that pleathery note which comes across as more of a rubbing alcohol note on the palate.\\n\\n**Finish** - Black pepper, cinnamon, rubbing alcohol, a bit of fruit, with a bit of cider vinegar coming in after a bit.\\n\\nThis is interesting in some ways, and not unpleasant, but there’s nothing here that would keep me coming back. It has some of the same things going on as Ritt Rye, but with less richness and depth, and that off-putting pleathery note (which I don’t mind on the nose, actually).  I wouldn’t turn this down, but I wouldn’t seek it out either.\\n\\n**82**/100\\n',\n",
       " 'I was quite pleasantly surprised by Alberta Premium’s entry-level whisky, an eponymous six-year-old made of 100% rye. Alberta Premium Dark Horse Canadian Whisky is the newest offering from the company (who are owned by Beam, but who unfortunately do not export their whiskies outside of Canada), a darker, higher-ABV, (ostensibly) more strongly flavoured whisky. My guess is that it’s designed to compete with the Crown Royal Black and a few other recent entries in the Canadian market of darker, spicier, higher-alcohol whiskies. \\n\\nIt’s also unique in the Alberta Premium line-up for not actually being 100% rye—apparently it’s about 8% corn whisky, and about 1% of the product is finished in sherry (rather than oak) casks. Again, none of this is on the bottle (it all comes according to Davin over at www.canadianwhisky.org), but it also appears to be a blend of 12- and 6-year-old varieties.\\n\\nIt also happens to be pretty good, and for an exceptional price, of $29 Cdn.\\n\\nAlberta Premium Dark Horse Canadian Whisky; NAS; 45% ABV; presumably chill-filtered and caramel-coloured.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Far too dark not to be caramel-coloured (even with a bit of sherry finishing), legs are decent. Bottle design is cool and minimalist, for what it’s worth.\\n\\n**Nose:** Quite mild at first. I had to cram my nose right down into the glass for a bit before I got anything, but she opens up gradually. Oak and oaky vanilla, but well-integrated and almost like a bourbon vanilla than the typical Canadian whisky vanilla. Toffee, caramel, maple—the standards you seem to get from most Canadian whiskies, but again well-integrated, and set off with a nice bit of rye spice. Herbal. Lavender (?) and other flowers. But also a bit of tang or tartness that’s actually quite nice. Charcoal. Berries. Brown sugar. Plums? Raisins. The corn and the sherry influence are, I think, both there without being overbearing. Lovely. Neither the range nor the intensity of the superior Lot No. 40, but complex and enjoyable. A couple drops of water really bring out the vanilla/maple/brown sugar and the nice tang, but at the cost of a bit of the complexity in the back.\\n\\n**Taste:** An oddly light mouthfeel, especially considering the ABV. Peppery and spicy, but not even a hint of alcohol burn. Lightly smoky in a way I’m not sure I’ve encountered in a non-Scotch whisky. Vanilla, clean oak, toffee, maple, caramel. Rye spice. Sweet, dark and light fruits. Still that nice mix of sweetness with a tang. Molasses (or brown sugar, maybe?). Licorice out of nowhere. Again, delightful. For the price point, fabulous. Water seems to bring out the fruitiness (raisins, especially) and the rye character a bit more—both the actual quality of the grain and the spiciness of it, but I think this guy might be preferable without.\\n\\n**Finish:** Doesn’t go on forever, but respectable. Some nice spice, and oak tannins. Faint smoke, and charcoal. Woodchips. Berries and dried, dark fruits after a bit.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** I’m two-for-two on Canadian whisky purchases this past couple of weeks. Tasty, robust, complex while still being accessible—a good sipping whisky at an outstanding price. Much better and more complex than the entry-level Alberta Premium (even though I liked that one, too) for a couple bucks more. Absolutely worth trying if you can find a bottle, and a reminder to our friends to the South that you shouldn’t be writing off Canadian whisky just because of the stuff we traditionally prefer shipping your way. Pester Beam to start distributing this internationally (or don’t, and leave it all for me).\\n\\n**Score:** 86/100\\n',\n",

       " 'It’s Canada Day!  TOModera brought it to my attention and given that I had a really good trip to Toronto a month back and have had two great trade experiences with Canadian redditors, I figured I’d celebrate by typing up a review I’d meant to post a few weeks ago.  This one is for the Canadian whisky that came highly recommended as one I should pick up, and thankfully the recommendations did not steer me wrong.  There’s a reason everyone seems to love Alberta Premium Dark Horse and I’m happy to have brought a couple bottles back with me.  Other than limited editions like the Heart of Gold, this and Lot 40 seem to top the “you should try this…” lists, so I may crack my Lot 40 sample tonight.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAlberta Premium Dark Horse bills itself (on the back of the bottle, in both French and English) as “RAISING THE BAR IN CANADIAN WHISKY.  Dark Horse was crafted for the next generation of whisky connoisseurs [which, interestingly, is translated differently in French] who are ready for a bolder, richer tasting Canadian whisky.  Expertly distilled using our finest Canadian Prairie rye grain, Dark Horse is blended at a higher strength with a small pot distilled batch that has been aged in handpicked charred oak barrels. The result is an ultra smooth rye whisky that imparts flavours of vanilla, smoke, sweet oak and blackcurrant.”  I like that description: none of the fake artsy-folksy backstory so prevalent in the bourbon world these days but instead an acknowledgement that they’re trying to do something new, and in this case they’ve succeeded.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the web, it’s “a mingling of 12-year-old rye whisky and 6-year-old small pot rye, Dark Horse has an 8% dollop* of well-aged corn whisky added to flesh out the body. The whisky is aged in heavily charred American white oak barrels, and is bottled at 45% alc/vol. Rich oak caramels and vanillas imbue Dark Horse with classic bourbon notes which complement the signature spiciness of Canadian Prairie rye grain.”  In addition to the aforementioned corn whisky dollop, there’s also a “smidgen” (0.5%-1.0%) of sherry added, too.  \\n\\n\\n\\n45% ABV – 90 proof. Enjoyed neat in a Glencairn glass, right after pouring it and then letting it air for 15-20 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Cost:** CAD 29.95.  A steal at the price, doubly so if I’d gone to Canada a day later when it went on sale for CAD 24.95.\\nColor/Appearance: Medium amber, like Grade A maple syrup.  I’m sure I’m not the first and won’t be the last to use the maple syrup analogy but it fits, both in taste and appearance. Not very viscous; legs don’t last.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Nose:** Delicious nose that promises a sweet sip but undercounts it with a blast of alcohol but not overpoweringly so. My notes say sweet, maple and vanilla with hints of orange and more maple on the back end. My wife had previously talked about cloves and gingersnaps but today said “butterscotch and gasoline.”  I see where she gets that since there’s a faint paint thinner note that ties in with the alcohol zing, but it’s not huge or particularly unpleasant. In fact, it helps cut what would otherwise be quite – and maybe too –sweet. After a few minutes in the glass the gasoline/paint thinner is gone and it smoothes out considerably, with more of the butterscotch plus burnt sugar and caramel.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Taste:** Smooth and sweet – again, maple syrup comes easily to mind but without the cloying sweetness.  It’s warm and smooth, with an oily mouthfeel that gives way to a pleasant alcohol burn.  More of the butterscotch, which is enhanced by the smooth oily feel.\\nFinish: The lingering alcohol burn passes and is replaced by a pleasant deeper sweetness: more of the caramel and vanilla, and the dark red fruit they talk about on the bottle is there at the back, too.  I didn’t get the smoke they talked about (maybe because I’m used to peaty Scotch) or really the sweet oak (which is fine since to me, “sweet oak” brings to mind overly buttery Chardonnay, whereas this is a nice mellow butterscotch/caramel).\\n\\n\\n\\n**Score: 92** – My highest rating yet (of three reviews).  Some of the score is definitely because of the price – I gave E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof a 90 and that’s delicious, too, and more complex for sure, but also hard to find and in the $90-100 range when I do.  I’d likely drink that one over this… but it’s a completely different beast and fills a different role in my cabinet and drinking habits.  This is available (or would be if I lived in Canada), affordable and delicious.  When I’m just sitting around having a relaxing night, lately I’ve found myself going to this more than I would most entry-level bourbons.  It’s not necessarily the most challenging or complex – which isn’t to say there’s nothing going on here – but it’s good. It would be a great drink when you need something warm and comforting in the winter; as it is, it’s 90 degrees outside and I’m still happily sipping away.  I probably sound like I’m damning with faint phrase but in fact it’s the opposite: this is what it is, and what it is is awfully good, for a great price.  My thanks to everyone who recommended I pick it up.\\n\\n\\n\\nInteresting that I’m coming to realize that I apparently like higher rye whiskies.

       " 'Apparently great minds think alike (hey there, [TOModera](http://www.reddit.com/user/TOModera)!), as I *also* recently headed out and picked up a bottle of Alberta Springs, with the thought process being something along the lines of, “ehh, $20, and worse comes to worse, I’ve got enough ginger ale in my fridge to keep the rye and gingers flowing until it’s done.”\\n\\nAlberta Springs is the older brother to Alberta Premium, the only widely available Canadian “rye” whisky that is, actually 100% rye (and so a whisky that has something of a cult-following). Curiously, the older Alberta Springs isn’t necessarily the same mashbill—occasionally a bit of corn or barley makes it into the finished product, if it’s consistent with the brand’s flavour profile.\\n\\n**Alberta Springs Canadian Rye Whisky**; 10 years old; 40% ABV; 750mL; retails for about $25 Cdn. in Alberta (though if you go hunting, I’ve seen it on sale for as little as $20).\\n\\n**Appearance:** e150a. Amber. I’m fairly impressed by the legs, though, for low ABV and price point—they’re wide and have a bit of staying power. The branding is fine. It’s twenty bucks, so what else can you hope for?\\n\\n**Nose:** Fairly intense dusty rye. Rye bread. Some menthol. Caramel/toffee/butterscotch/vanilla. Maple or maple syrup. Something faintly herbal or medicinal. Cinnamon. Licorice (and/or black licorice?). Grape. Apple (green apple in particular). Orange peel. Pickle juice. Lumber or sawdust, maybe pencil shavings? Actually, not bad—the 40% ABV feels like a shame here, as the nose is actually pretty compelling, but could just use being turned up a notch.\\n\\n**Taste:** Not a bad body for 40%. Sweet in a fairly typical Canadian whisky way, though not to the point of being cloying. Vanilla. Apples/apple juice. Pear juice. Grape. Slight sour pickle. Butterscotch/toffee/caramel, and the typical maple-esque note. But a nice bit of rye spice. Some cinnamon, ginger, clove. Orange peel as on the nose, or maybe Terry’s Chocolate orange. Light pepper. Light mint. Rye sandwich bread. Some light woodiness. Leans a bit too heavy on the typical Canadian whisky sweetness (which I’ve drifted away from a bit in recent years), but has a nice amount of complexity and character for 40% ABV and a $20 bottle.\\n\\n**Finish:** Short-to-medium. Pulls back on the sweetness of the taste, with a nice bit of spiciness, rye, and baking spices. Ginger. Vanilla and some hints of wood-sap. Light licorice or anise. Faint hints of cornmeal.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** Actually, colour me somewhat impressed. Way more drinkable neat than a $20 bottle—and particularly a $20 bottle of Canadian whisky—has any right to be. I would not turn this down in any situation: it takes what makes the standard Alberta Premium compelling, and adds an extra layer of complexity while also smoothing out the edges (and pulling back on the sweetness a bit, if my memories of the younger brother are correct). Of course, I don’t think people buy this particular bottle with sipping in mind generally, and indeed there’s a reason why this bad boy has a speed-pourer affixed in the attached photo: ‘cause the Alberta Springs makes a pretty solid rye and ginger. And I have been using it for such. So, points for versatility as well. Someone tell Alberta Distillers to release a Limited Edition at (at least) 45% ABV, please.\\n\\n**Score:** 82\\n',\n",

Unfortunately due to holiday shopping and some pretty rough shipments, I'm not really doing full bottle swaps anymore. Contact him if you'd like, I think he's still looking for someone to swap with. \\n\\nHowever I did offer to go out and try one of the Canadian Whiskies requested, **Alberta Springs**.\\n\\nThe last time I had this I wasn't impressed, and expressed that to /u/GWCad. However I had never done a full review, which for me is like commenting on a car I've never driven and saying I don't like it. So I went out and picked up a bottle of this. Worst case scenario, I have a new cooking whisky.\\n\\n**Alberta Springs** is made by Alberta Distillers, known for their Alberta Premium line, and owned by Beam Inc. It is sometimes 100% rye, though doesn't state that on the bottle. Why? Well, it's a blend. And sometimes there are non-rye whiskies used in the blend, if that matches the flavour they are going for. It's aged for 10 years, first individually in oak, then blended, and then back into the oak.\\n\\nAnd finding out that much was a pain as they don't have a website.

Really good mouth feel, and I usually ignore mouth feel, but this mouth feel is good.\\n\\nWell that sounded insane. What I'm saying is there's a good consistency to this, which is surprising, as I'm pretty sure it's chill filtered.\\n\\nAlso does Beam have to add in Funk into everything?

Don't think I like it too much, wish that it had more of the spice from the taste.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** My original assessment of this whisky was incorrect. Frankly I didn't give it enough of a chance, and I apologize, it's no lame duck. Yes, it has a low Abv., that typical maple/sugar taste to it, and there's a Beam Funk present that I wish wasn't. However the consistency is good, the nose is unique, and for it's problems, the finish isn't the worst I've ever had. I bought a 1.14 L bottle, so more than likely I'll be using this to cook/bake with, however I'll still be drinking it.

A couple of tea notes, black tea and a roast corn tea specifically, follow along.\\n\\n**Palate:** It\\'s quite light in flavor and a rather easy drinker. There\\'s a bit of generic whisky flavor, largely with a grain sweetness. Roast corn tea from the nose sticks around as does a bit of an orange jelly candy.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium in length. For the first few sips, the finish was quite creamy which almost gave the whole package a boba milk tea vibe. With more sips though, the cream dissipated and light oriental medicine notes come through. Ginseng and red ginseng specifically were what were noticeable.\\n\\n*********\\n\\n**Conclusion:** On the 80th birthday of the more famous [Alex Ferguson of Glasgow](https://i.imgur.com/Dk3Ztrt.png), it only felt fitting to try this old blend carrying the same name. By best estimation, this blend by Alex Ferguson & Co. comes from the 1930s and really the only remarkable things about it are that it has survived so long and the name. The whisky itself is quite simple and comes across as a rather generic blend. I have no way of knowing if that\\'s just a byproduct of time or if that\\'s simply how it would\\'ve been before, but I would guess it\\'s probably a bit of both. I\\'m glad to have been able to try it, especially since it is easily the oldest distillate I\\'ve ever had.

       " '**Review #181: Allt-a-Bhainne 1996 Gordon and Macphail**\\n\\nAnother new distillery to review for this week, this time Allt-a-Bhainne which is a Speyside distillery built and founded fairly recently in 1975. Located just down the road from Dufftown, this distillery is owned by Pernod Ricard and mainly provides malt for Chivas Regal and is apparently an integral part of the malt ingredient in that blend. They do not bottle their own whisky and instead can only be found through independent bottlers which is how I tried this whisky being from Gordon and Macphail.\\n\\nThis whisky was aged for 16 years in refill sherry hogsheads and bottled at 46% ABV\\n\\n* Colour: Clear Gold\\n* Nose: Lemon citrus, temperate fruits, light vanilla, creamy nuts, floral, white pepper\\n* Taste: Apple, pear, light citrus, some honeydew, pepper, woodspice, nuts\\n* Finish: Medium-Long with soft caramel and treenuts\\n\\nThe notes are minimal but the mouthfeel on this whisky is very nice. Not super complex but full bodied and while for a 16 year old I wish it was more complex it’s still quite nice for what you get. Worth a try but not a buy.\\n\\n**80/100**',\n",
       " \"Allt-A-Bhainne is quite rarely talked about. It's the main malt component of many Chivas Regal blends. The distillery doesn't put out any official bottlings, so it's up to the independent ones. \\n\\nThis one was distilled in 1995 and bottled in 2012, it was bottled at a cask strength of 52.1% ABV.\\n\\n**Color**: Pale straw\\n\\n**Nose**: Starts of very clean and fresh: some lemon and melons. Then comes a grassy note followed by oak. After some time you get some hay. A very clean nose.\\n\\n**Palate**: Lot's of fruit on the first sip: Lemon, melons, green apples. Then some cereal and grain, ginger and spices. It's a bit hot but not overly so.\\n\\n**Finish**: Very long! Becomes bitter, liquorice. Wow this is really a long aftertaste...I'm impressed.\\n\\nThis was much better than I expected, considering there's little to no fanfare about this distillery. It's also quite complex.

They shouldn't even own shoes yet.\\n\\nAnd how boy, it may be young, but it's been passed around a lot (dude, not cool!). Started by Chivas Brothers, then moved over to Seagrams, and finally ended up with Pernod Ricard (because who doesn't love a French lover later in life).\\n\\nSo, it's young, interesting, and was bottled when I was just able to start drinking (illegally and get away with it).

It's sweet, and lemony, and those two things have come together well. That said, it's all I can smell for a long ass time.\\n\\nA long ass time.\\n\\nReally fucking long.\\n\\nEventually it comes down, and there's a brine to it which doesn't go too well with the sweetness.\\n\\n**Taste:** Brine, pepper, olive oil, Sprite, grass-y\\n\\nMore brine! Yay! Little hot, decent mouth feel, though kinda bland. The flavours don't really go together too well.\\n\\nWish that it had more to do with the nose.\\n\\n**Finish:** Lemon, brine, cumin, sand, herbs, cotton, nectarine\\n\\nOh look! It's all mixing together! Isn't that... great? Because I've always wanted to have a mixture of kosher pickles and lemon tarts.\\n\\nThat's sarcasm by the way. It's interesting, just not great.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Couple things that are going on here. First off, the dram could have had some oxidization. So I'll ignore some of the brine. However beyond that, it's disjoint, herbal and sweet at odd times, and doesn't really jive with itself. It's self jive isn't high.\\n\\nI think the low Abv isn't helping either. We have notes that taste weaker than they should be, or aren't full developed, which is odd for an 18 year old Scotch.\\n\\nOh well.

There is a bit of a funk like hardboiled eggs, vinegar, or slightly off fish that permeates the nose. Beyond the funky aroma of a hawker center food court in the early morning there are tasty tropical fruits: snake fruit, lychee, and coconut. Honeyed sweetness comes out along with a bit of green grape or tart grapefruit. There is so many interesting things buried in the aroma that it is easy to miss the faint smoke of ginger or turmeric frying on a well seasoned cast iron wok.\\n\\n**Palate** : Restrained with a straight jacket, the profile is mellow almost to the point of being like sweet watery mead. The dram tastes old, not refined, but like old things: a shriveled lemon, dried flowers, and overripe fruit. A sour bitterness comes on the back end: sulfur stink, dried salted plums, bitter menthol. In two separate blind tastings the wife described it as ‘licking a mossy stump’ and then as ‘bamboo panda snack.’ There is certainly some wood influence, but aside from a punch of spice near the opening the dram ends up mostly slightly sour honey water.\\n\\n**Finish** : Lingering sour and bitter notes of lemons, sulfur, and oak spices.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Grade** : D\\n\\n**Mental Image** : Tropical Food Stalls at Night; near the garbage a sweet putrid scent hands in stale air.\\n\\n**Something Better** : Caol Ila 6 Year SMWS 53.276 (similar moss & rot, less bitter, more cohesive)\\n\\n**Something Similar** : Yamazaki 12 Year (similar fruit, less rotten, less complex, less finish)\\n\\n**Something Worse** : Dewars White Label (similar mead/sweetness, less complex, more tea notes)\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Notes :** Oh man this was a bit disappointing.

At more than three times the age and price, this was just no where near as impressive, and it certainly was not three times better. It was interesting— just not cohesive.\\n\\nThe flavors were not all bad, but on the whole they just feel a bit washed out and the bitter notes a bit too prevalent. This is so adjacent to being good that it was not a D that could be a C, it was a D that could have been a B if things had just turned out a little bit different. I am not sure if some of the bitter off notes were a product of the cask— usually I would associate those more with sherry than bourbon, or if that is just part of the spirit. I usually love all sorts of rotten notes and the aroma of a tropical hawker center with its lines of food stalls makes my mouth water. There were just too many bitter or sour notes flittering around in there for the decay and fruits to really come together in a tasty package. The dram was a bit too restrained to really bite into and savor, just too washed out (or up) in the end.\\n\\nMaybe the fact that the distillery is misspelled on the label should have been a warning?\\n\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average but still lovely; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)\\n\\n> just a note that this is an external link; for my convenience I've archived my reviews on a personal site.\",\n",

It is a freshly placed Combat roach trap or maybe a Hoy-Hoy. It is not unpleasant— and roaches sure seem to enjoy it. A bit of musty vinegar, faint herbal notes, and a dash of lemon grass. Hints of meatiness and faint smoke play at the edges of perception.\\n\\n**Palate** : Herbaceous with a sweet meaty quality. It is roasted pork seasoned with Chinese five spice, burnt marshmallows, melting s’mores, and a bit of fish sauce. Burning rotten vegetation blows over along with the sweet scent of pond scum, Lily pads, and tadpoles.

Something about the vinegar notes present in some whiskies give the impression that they might help cut through beef broth or compliment a sweet fish sauce. I do not do a whole lot of intentional whisky and food pairings aside from the obvious salty or coastal paired with a funky creamy cheese, or a smokey peat heavy dram with a rich beef stew.\\n\\nI never did get around to this pairing. It was too good to save for such an occasion. I have never found the smell of roach traps to be all that appetizing, but after this, I may instinctively start craving whisky. Something about the aroma strikes the sense in such a way to resemble roach bait. If I left a dram out on the counter would I find some drunk roaches?\\n\\nI am not in the mood to share and find out. This Allt-a-Bhainne showed remarkable complexity for just 7 years. Its flavors were distinct and well rounded, it drank incredibly smoothly without a drop of water— to the point that I almost forget each time I tasted it to add a few drops and see what happened. It has lovely layers of rotting vegetation, herbs, algae, and maybe a bit of mold. It is not quite the funk level that Bruichladdich achieves with some Port Charlottes, but it is in the same ballpark and therefore right up my alley.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average but still lovely; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)\\n\\n> just a note that this is an external link; for my convenience I've archived my reviews on a personal site.\",\n",

Toasted herbs come in with fresh cut sticky rosemary twigs, grassy dried hay, salty olives, and agave. Briny pickle juice, olives, and sugary citrus 7-Up emerge over time.\\n\\n**Palate** : Medium to light body with notes of toasted cacao, herbs, and nuts. Toasted marshmallows over a kerosene-stink campfire, hot tar, malty graham and grains, bitter chocolate, and burnt hay.

Allt-a-Bhaine produces some really weird drams; or, SMWS choses to bottle a lot of really weird casks from the distillery. This one occasionally verged toward the barnyard funk of Bruichladdich without dipping too deeply into some of the earthy manure or salty brine of a great Port Charlotte. \\n\\nThis dram was wonderfully tasty with lots of intriguing cocoa and malt notes infused by a pungent, slightly off, campfire. The nose on this was wonderfully rich even if the flavor profile held it back a bit being too delicate and light on the palate. While this was full of youth it was absolutely tasty and offered enough intriguingly strange notes that it was right up my alley with its funky s’more profile.',\n",

       " \"I was at a friend's place in Windsor this weekend and he has a fantastic, growing collection of whiskies that he picks up in his business travels.  [Here's a post on the TWS website with a bit more detail about the weekend including why there is a picture of fire and a scared waitress!](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/2017/04/06/some-ndp-bourbon-reviews/?preview_id=2797&preview_nonce=b4905b2511) I decided to try a bunch of sourced bourbon rather than the distillery releases, as they're the ones I'm less likely to get a chance to try in the future. Notes will be pretty short, as I was more focused on socializing than taking detailed notes. \\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n####**Flatboat Bourbon – 45%**\\n\\nThe first is Flatboat Bourbon, which I’d never heard of before. It’s a private label offering for Liquor Barn from Barton distillery. The juice is apparently 6-8yrs old.\\n\\n**Nose:** Banana, corn, very sweet, typical oak spice and caramel.\\n\\n**Palate:** Sharp, bitter, banana, corny, over oaked\\n\\n**Finish:** Short, sweet, bitter\\n\\n**Score:** 74/100\\n\\nThe nose on this is really nice with a pronounced banana note, but the palate and finish kind of disappoints. Barton may have sold some off-profile casks for this bottling.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n####**Wathen’s Single Barrel – 47%**\\n\\nThis is a bottling by the Medley Company, which has been doing this for 8 generations. It’s a non-distilling producer, and the source of this juice is unknown. It’s a corn/rye/malted barley mashbill with a 77/10/13 split.\\n\\n**Nose:** some Dill, spice, oak, caramel, corny. Pretty grain forward.\\n\\n**Palate:** spice, way more rye influence than I expected from something with such a low rye content, oaky caramel.\\n\\n**Finish:** Short spicy\\n\\n**Score:** 80/100\\n\\na nice average bourbon that doesn’t wow, but doesn’t disappoint either. Probably a lot of variation given these are single barrel releases, but I’d be tempted to pick this up as a nice cocktail bourbon or simple sipper.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n####**Noah’s Mill – 57.15%**\\n\\nThis is the non-age stated version of Noah’s Mill, and I didn’t catch a batch number. This is sourced bourbon, but apparently from the same people who do Willett. I’d heard of it, but never had it before this past weekend.\\n\\n**Nose:** Some rye spice, corn, oak\\n\\n**Palate:** Spicy… Some Laci Bacillus, dill, really musty. Definitely tastes like an off barrel\\n\\n**Finish:** Short & sharp\\n\\n**Score:** 67/100\\n\\nThis had some really bad off notes. Learned at Wiser’s that the mustiness can be due to grain sitting too long in a storage facility where moisture can get in and infection ensues. Looking at the other reviews online, it seems like this is a serious outlier. Unfortunate, and I’ll have to give it another try someday.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n####**Belle Meade 9 Single Barrel – 60.55%**\\n\\nI had never heard of this one before either, but it’s put out by the GreenBrier Distillery and seems to be sourced.  This is a store select from Liquor Barn, with 36% rye and 9yrs old.\\n\\n**Nose:** Sour mash, oak corn, sweet, honey, some fruit\\n\\n**Palate:** lots of fruit, caramel, vanilla, lemon, estery, dill, incredibly spicy and peppery\\n\\n**Finish:** medium length and spicy\\n\\n**Score:** 85/100\\n\\nI liked this a lot, found it well balanced with depth of flavour. Single barrels are so hit and miss, but this was a nice one.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n####**Amador Double Barrel – 43.4%**\\n\\nThis is another sourced bourbon, by the Amador Whisky co. They apparently bought 280 barrels between 3-10yrs old and then finished them in Napa wine barrels for another 6 months.\\n\\n**Nose:** Rye spice, fruit, winey, oak, caramel, some sugar, raisins, cinnamon\\n\\n**Palate:** Great rye spice, oaky, very nice light wine notes, red fruit, dried fruit and raisins, sugary, caramel, cinnamon, cloves\\n\\n**Finish:** medium length, sweet, oak\\n\\n**Score:** 87/100\\n\\ndelicious. Fantastic balance of classic bourbon notes and some extra fruitiness from the wine finish. Really really nice. Punches above its weight. If I come across this bottle in the US I’ll very likely buy it.\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nTo our friends, a big thanks for opening up your home and liquor collection for us! Will be sure to return the favour next time you’re in Toronto!\",\n",

Before any mouthfeel impressions could form, my focus shifted to the prominent bitter note. The dram is low heat and light body (somewhat watery). I get a bit of dry cigar ash and corn husk in addition to the fruit notes. \\n* **Finish:** Light and bitter (sorry for the redundancy).

       " 'WW Review #1\\n\\nHey guys ! Gaija here for my first world whisky review. This one comes from German IB \"vom Fass\" which brings its own selected casks up into the very shop and lets you taste anything you want directly from smaller, water-diluted quarter casks. Once something convinces you, they\\'ll fill any size of bottle from 100 to 1000 ml with it, pricing accordingly. I found the concept very enjoyable and the whiskies very good (though not cheap), so I bought a few things, including this. I was told its distillery was neither Amrut (albeit the name) nor Paul John nor anything that bottled things on its own but rather an undisclosed micro-distillery.\\n\\n**\"Amrita\" 6yo, Indian Single Malt, 45%**\\n\\n* **Colour** : dark amber already. Very active oak aging under these lattitudes, granted, but there must have been some sherry in that, no way it\\'s only bourbon.\\n\\n* **Nose** : there\\'s been some sherry in this, no doubt now. **Wood** is what strikes first when sniffing just after the pour, and it\\'s very **perfumy** as well, with notes of Turkish bath and soapy roses that makes you think, \"well, I guess India makes sense\". Perfumy in a good way, no FWP here. Two things take the crown from then on : **grape juice and brown butter**, which, along with walnuts and big meaty tones, seem to confirm sherry has been used. Vinegar and dried oranges, dusty wood … yup, makes sense, but I wish it evolved more. Let\\'s wait. - 20 minutes later - Ok now, I\\'m glad I waited. It\\'s become super interesting, because now it is **suprisingly lactic** : fresh butter, salted butterfugde, milk chocolate, dairy cream, milkshake, you name it. Combined with the woody (sandal, turkish bath) and fruity (**overripe orange**, mango) notes, this is as unusual as superb, really. Unique and worth the wait.\\n\\n* **Palate** : I found the first sip a bit light in alcohol, but that\\'s not surprising given it has aerated for a good 30-40 minutes now. Taking a bigger sip solves the problem, and here once more the profile is just great : a tiny bit of varnish and those soapy tones I already mentioned but no problem, even for someone who hates varnishy notes like me. Here it\\'s just an exotic introduction to the rest : **big fat butterfudge, cappucino** (really, like the logic sum of the sherry and the lactic components), some light pepper and cocoa, something between **hazelnut and meat juice**. Great ! Upon swallowing, it changes and becomes completely unexpectable with **humid, musty** tones of mushrooms, chlorine, forest mosses … dang ! Much more complex and tertiary than I thought on the first sip, impressive.\\n\\n* **Finish** : traces of the afore-mentioned fruitiness reappear, with mango and bitter orange, but the whole soon gets **more austere and mineral** (not in a bad way) with **metallic** sides (a drop of blood when you lick a cut, know what I mean ?), musty earth as before, dairy cream again (dairy cream on its own tastes metallic to me, maybe my brain\\'s just fucked up), chlorine again, with fresh **tobacco** and cork as well. Not the best part, not extremely long (hey, it\\'s 45% after all), but far from bad anyway\\n\\n* **Comments** : I know it\\'s true for virtually any whisky or any hobby really but damn how rewarding is that to be patient. Let it breath, for long, longer if needed, but it will pay. An excellent surprise in the end. Only downsides are a slight lack of oomph on the palate, a bit too much wood / grapes on the nose. The perfumy flowers and wood incenses will maybe not convince anyone, to boot, but they\\'re an asset here, nothing like cheap Hibiki nail polish or slutty Bowmore, rest assured. Hats off to vom Fass and this mysterious distillery. **87/100**\\n',\n",

While the 10 year peated ex-sherry edition did not match my admittedly lofty expectations, this was absolutely what I hoped it would be. It was rich and bold in flavor, slightly dry from sustained wood contact in a hot environment, and with a finish that = lasted and lasted. There was so much complexity to sift through in the dram, that I could easily sit with a single pour all night just watching different layers of flavor surface.\\n\\nWith the Angel’s Share in Bangalore upwards of 10%, after a decade, the majority of the cask is gone. All that was left is a rich and thick single malt which Amrut vatted with a handful of sister casks to create each Greedy Angel’s release. I imagine, considering volume loss to the Angels, that we are talking somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 casks in order to produce the 900 bottles that made up this release.\\n\\nThis truly is a wonderful bottle and its perfect for any fan of Amrut. Whether or not it is worth the $800 price tag will no doubt depend a great deal on what you are comfortable spending on whisky— its clearly not a release for everyone. While I loved this, I do not spend that kind of money on a bottle, so it is hard to say it is really worth it— at least personally— knowing I would never have spent that kind of money on an entire bottle. But if you are looking for an excellent Amrut and money is no barrier, then this might just be perfect.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average but still lovely; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)\\n\\n* [**Other Amrut Reviews**](https://whiskeryturnip.com/home/tag/Amrut)',\n",

The other was this one. \\n\\nIt’s not the oldest Amrut out there (there’s apparently a 12-year-old Greedy Angels release), but it’s certainly the oldest I’ve had. Amrut loses 12-14% of their whisky to the angel’s share (evaporation) in the first year, with an additional ~10% lost for every year after that. According to the “world’s biggest Amrut fan” Dennis Steckel, who happened to be in attendance at the tasting, “quite a few” bourbon barrels went into this release of only 900 bottles.\\n\\n***\\n\\t\\t\\n**Amrut 10 Greedy Angels Chairman’s Reserve.** Indian single malt. 55% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Maturation:** Aged 10 years in ex-bourbon barrels. Bottled at cask strength, yielding 900 bottles total. \\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 15 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Colour:** Deep gold.\\n\\n**Nose:** Rich and sweet. Buttery vanilla, deep malt, and sugar cookies. Tropical fruit notes of dried mango and pineapple, as well as yellow apple, tangerine. There’s a light mustiness, more of an “aged” note than an oak note. A floral black tea note emerged as it rested.\\n\\n**Palate:** Medium-thick texture, some heat. Big beeswax on the arrival, then tart fruit, pineapple, and cinnamon. Very rich and creamy on the development, with brown sugar, coconut cake, apple crumble, and almonds. Some charred oak and spice emerge. There's some orange marmalade, candied citron, and guava jelly on buttered toast. Slightly earthy towards the back.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium-long and spicy. Spiced wood, brown sugar, clove, cardamom, rose petals, and exotic oils. Apricot jam and more guava jelly. Vanilla and butter return.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Possible SMWS bottling name: “Tropical island va-cake-tion”**\\n \\t   \\n**Notes:** This didn’t disappoint. Amazing richness, big tropical fruit and barley sugar, deep complex spice, balanced oak, even some wax – it’s got everything you could want from this kind of bottling. It’s almost just a better version of the standard single malt, just with an extra layer of butter and vanilla. It’s not on the level of Spectrum, but then again what is? Those angels have excellent taste!\\n\\n**Final score: 88/100** \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. \\n\\n60-69: Not so good. I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but it can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Decent whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Quite good. Quality stuff.\\n\\n85-89: Excellent, a standout dram.\\n\\n90-94: Sublime, a personal favourite in its category.\\n\\n95-100: As good as it gets. Jaw-dropping, eye-widening, unforgettable whisky.\\n\\n***\\n\\n*My rating scale is based purely on flavour experience, and does not take value-for-money or willingness to purchase a bottle into account.

Faintly earthy mineral notes come through as a hot brick kiln, or dusty sun baked stones. The aroma is musty and mellows out quite a bit from the initial rush of spices as it breaths. Old books, dry parchment, and an oil lamp hint at the aged peated malt.\\n\\n**Palate** : Syrupy and thick, the dram rolls down the tongue leaving behind an oaky astringency. Loads of rich toasted spices make themselves known— cinnamon, mace, and cloves along with faintly sweet orange peel and burnt toast. Toward the end sherried notes of milk chocolate and a funky bitter burnt herbs come through.\\n\\n**Finish** : Lingering coal embers and sizzling rich BBQ sauce.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Grade** : B-\\n\\n**Mental Image** : BBQ sauce on hot coals.\\n\\n**Something Better** : Amrut Spectrum 004 (similar syrupy thickness, more stewed fruit/tobacco)\\n\\n**Something Similar** : Amrut Peated Cask Strength (more prominent coal smoke, less spice, more fruit)\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Notes :** I really wanted to like this so I am not entirely sure if my love of Amrut might be inflating my score just a little bit. The dram was tasty with loads of complex spice notes vying to come forward with a relatively subdued peat influence. If I were to factor in cost for this bottle, there is no way I could ever give it a passing score. While it is good, it does not taste $800 good— I am not sure what whisky could taste $800 good, I assume it must be some level of exceptional nectar of the Gods while also having immense sentimental value. This is a luxury dram, something better suited for collectors and fans of Amrut more ardent than myself. The problem with any hype train is that it derails as often as it ends up at the wrong station leaving you no where near the destination on your ticket. \\n\\nI was absolutely thrilled for the chance to finally try a bottle of Amrut’s Greedy Angels range—especially one that hit the double digits in age after spending a decade in Bangalore’s notorious heat— even better that it was distilled from peated Scottish barley. According to Amrut one year in the Indian heat is equal to about three years in Scotland as the 'Angel’s Share' of whisky lost to evaporation out of the cask is typically a bit north of 10% instead of 2-3% per year. I actually feel as though the peat influence on this one reflects this idea of 3X speed aging better than the peated Aatma I reviewed earlier in Fall 2019. However, while time did mellow out a lot of the peat, the dram does feel a little bit over oaked as oaky spices, tannins, and astringency dominate much of the palate.\\n\\nThis is far from an everyday dram— Amrut has a number of excellent more affordable products— but if you have the money to burn on status whiskies or collectables— then this might be a fun pickup. Also a noteworthy as the last Chairman’s Reserve expression chosen by Neel Jagdale before his passing. This whisky is best suited for the collector and fan of Amrut, especially those who met Chairman Jagdale and feel a deep connection to the cask selection.\\n\\nAs a final note, let me admit that I find the name somewhat confusing— usually when a dram is labeled “sherry finish” its because the whisky was finished in a sherry cask, in this case it was aged primarily in a sherry cask before it was split into two smaller casks, an ex-bourbon and virgin oak, for a final finish.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average but still lovely; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)\\n\\n* [**Other India Reviews**](https://whiskeryturnip.com/home/tag/India)\\n\\n> just a note that this is an external link; for my convenience I've archived my reviews on a personal site.\",\n",

The finish picks up more creamy oak, complemented by a light tropical melon-like note and with the aforementioned cooking spices kicked up another notch. \\n\\nThe ex-bourbon accentuates the core Amrut profile really well, with the end result creamy, musky and spicy with a really satisfying weight.

We poured this during a local virtual tasting over the holidays as a blind bonus sample after a night of peat. I managed to sneak a taste a few days before we began and I was excited to see what the group thought, but I was surprised just how popular the dram proved to be. Reactions varied widely with most tasters pegging this as an Islay, several voices guessed Bowmore as a source, and most assumed it was a few years shy of two decades. This was generally very well received and most people ranked it as their second favorite of the evening.  There certainly was a vaguely maritime and mineral layer of flavors that sat somewhere in the background which made this a really interesting one to sip on.\\n\\nOverall, this was a wonderfully complex Amrut which combined a lovely profile of fruit and smoke with rich notes of wood linking things together.

It was so good that I am actually surprised it was not picked up for an Amrut Greedy Angels release— it was certainly old enough and the quality was top notch.\\n\\nI loved this— though, the wife called it a ‘lesser Arran.’ It did remind me of a beautiful first fill ex-bourbon Arran; it had a lot of similar fruity notes with a faint earthiness, though this dipped deeper into fruit syrup notes than Arran typically does. So if you are a peat monster like my wife, you may find this a little one dimensional— if you love drams with strong tropical fruit profiles then this might be perfect for you.  \\n\\nI thought it took to water pretty well, a few drops cut down on the salt and pastry near the end to further underscore the fruity sugars. I would also recommend, as with many Amrut or any younger single malt aged in a hot climate, to give this plenty of time to breath.

       " 'Whisky has had an interesting effect on culture. Let\\'s take religion, and the use of the term \"Angel\\'s Share\".\\n\\nBefore people really understood alcohol and how it evaporated, they made up an idea that the angel\\'s were stealing some of it. Now either they really believed this or someone who\\'s a lot more witty than the average person made it up. I tried looking it up however a comedy drama kept coming up and I got annoyed.\\n\\nNone the less, this idea that angel\\'s love slow aged whisky at 2% a year is fascinating. Angel\\'s in the Christian sense aren\\'t human at all. They\\'re creepy and weird. However through time they\\'ve become more human, all to the point where they steal alcohol and everyone is like \"yeah, that makes sense\".\\n\\nIn warmer country\\'s this angel share is quite high. This brings us to **Amrut 8 Greedy Angels II**. After 8 years in India they\\'ve lost quite a bit to the Angel\\'s. What I\\'m saying is it\\'s better to be an Angel in India than in Scotland, regardless of the religion demographics. I\\'ve seen some people say the equivalent is a 30 year old whisky in Scotland.\\n\\nDoes this mean it tastes equivalent? Let\\'s see, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A at the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** India\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Colour:** 2.5Y 7/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Malt, coconut, funk, liquorice, tangerine lassie, apple cider\\n\\nRich flavour here. Like the 10 Greedy Angel\\'s, we see a good melding of flavours over other Amruts. However in comparison to the 10 again, we\\'re finding more complex flavours. \\n\\nMore spice and more funk. Also I don\\'t know if tangerine lassie\\'s are an actual thing, I just got that note I get from mango ones but it was more like tangerine. I hesitate to add it, however I expect someone will point out I\\'m wrong somewhere.\\n\\n**Taste:** Peach yoghurt, lime, bourbon vanilla ice cream, Wheatabix, currant\\n\\nLots of peach/sour notes, and lots of vanilla here. The last one had more of a dry, cereal note than a Champagne note. It\\'s different.\\n\\nAbout the same complexity on the taste, however I enjoyed this one more. Less dry and more creamy. Which sounds grosser than it really is.\\n\\n**Finish:** Pineapple, yeasty bread, sea air, oatmeal, oatmeal topped muffin, chocolate covered raisin\\n\\nAh, here\\'s the yeast. Much like when I go on a date, the yeast eventually shows up. That\\'s what I get for picking up at the bus station though.\\n\\nBrine, lots of oatmeal, some brown sugar, and chocolate.\\n\\nFlat out better than the 10 at the end.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I compare this one to the 10 year old quite a bit, and I feel that\\'s because the two are fighting for a complex whisky. While I think Amrut shines with younger malts that have really bonkers flavours, they are growing, and people will always wonder \"Did he shave his head to fake the cancer?\"... I mean, they\\'ll always wonder what an older Amrut tastes like.\\n\\nIn this case, I think we end up with a complex whisky. It\\'s not quite as great as others, as the alcohol goes lower. That said, you end up with a vanilla laden, cream filled complex whisky. And more in this vein is better. If that means we don\\'t quite wait 10 years next time, makes sense to me.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky review #280, India review #28, Whisky Network review #1218*\\n\\n*Other Amrut reviews:*\\n\\n* [Amrut 10 Greedy Angels](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5j636w/amrut_10_greedy_angels_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Bangalore Tiger Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1fuxdh/amrut_cask_strength_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Double Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5nizx0/amrut_double_cask_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Ex-Bourbon Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Fusion](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1g1jb1/amrut_fusion_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Indian Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Kadhambam No. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Naarangi](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Blackadder Raw Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1mrvhb/amrut_peated_cask_strengthreview/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Port Pipe Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Portonova](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut PX Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Rye](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5niz2b/amrut_rye_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Single Cask Virgin Oak](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5op21h/amrut_single_cask_virgin_oak_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n\\n* [Amrut Spectrum 004](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/76q9e6/amrut_spectrum_004_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Two Continents (2nd Release)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\\n',\n",

The smoke is heady and unmistakable— inescapable really. Even background notes feel infused with smoke— smoked vanilla, smoked honey, grilled pineapple, smoked thinly sliced beef jerky. The dram offers an earthy, faintly floral, or fruity sweetness to the smoke.\\n\\n**Palate** : For all the heady smoke of the nose, the palate is far more restrained. Medium bodied, slightly astringent, and very tannic— the dram opens with bitter burnt coffee and a wood fired brick oven— notes of perfectly crispy, that is to say slightly burnt, pizza crust round out the smoke and char. Gradually turns toward the savory fruitiness of jackfruit, dried mango, and a wet vegetable garden. There are loads of spices that come and go; black pepper, Chinese five spice, white peppers, licorice, and coriander.  \\n\\n**Finish** : Lingering earthy red clay infused with a bit of bitter mint and vanilla.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Grade** : C\\n\\n**Mental Image** : An urban garden; a respite from the traffic and smog of the streets beyond.\\n\\n**Something Better** : Ledaig 11 Year; The Exclusive Malts (similar brick oven, more salt & cheese)\\n\\n**Something Similar** : Amrut Peated Single Malt (more tropical fruits, less dominant smoke/spice)\\n\\n**Something Worse** : Johnnie Walker Black (similarly smoke centric, smoother, less complex, less finish)\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Notes :** A peated Amrut? Seven years old? How could I not jump onboard the hype train for Aatma. I am a big fan of what Amrut does with the peated barley they bring in from Scotland. They distill it beautifully and the casks age well in the Indian heat. As a fan, it is frustrating that I cannot source bottles locally, so when I had an opportunity to try this one, I felt compelled to jump on it.\\n\\nAfter seven years in the Southern Indian heat this dram packs a punch. The Amrut Aatma is a heavy hitter, nearly a peat bomb, and as such it needs time to breath— a lot of time to breath. My impression of it improved between tasting sessions as it had extra time to breath and open up. Seven years in an ex-bourbon cask imparted loads of wood spice and really spotlighted smokey notes from the peat. While Amrut states that as far as the angel’s share is concerned one year in India equals three in Scotland, the peat in this dram drinks more like a seven year than it does a twenty one year. Many Amruts do drink much older than they are— but I am not sure that the Indian climate mellows peat in the same way.\\n\\nI have previously enjoyed the various Amrut peated port pipe single casks I have tried and I believe their peated single malts benefit from a bold wine cask influence to balance the peat. This one is a bit too unbalanced and the strong wood spices cover up most of the lovely fruity notes I adore in Amrut. The nose has loads of wonderful variations on meaty peaty influence with just a hint of tropical fruit— the palate seems a bit simple in comparison. It is a tasty dram and one that I think any peathead would find fun to explore.\\n\\nSo who should get this bottle? This bottle will appeal to any Amrut Fever or Fan Club member, but it may be a bit unbalanced for anyone not looking to stamp their ‘peat world’ passport. It was interesting trying a peated Amrut aged in ex-bourbon instead of a wine cask and aged for much longer than you typically encounter outside of the Greedy Angel’s lineup.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Note on the Grade Scale** : Consider an A to be one of my favorites of all time; a B to be something I would buy for my cabinet; a C to be roughly average; a D to be acceptable and something I would drink if offered; and an F to be outright undrinkable except in dire circumstances.\\n\\n* [**Review Home & Archive**](https://whiskeryturnip.com)\\n\\n* [**Other Amrut Reviews**](https://whiskeryturnip.com/home/tag/Amrut)\\n\\n> just a note that this is now an external link; for my convenience I've archived my reviews on a personal site.\",\n",

Dried dates, cherries, and overripe oranges offered up a sweet fruity sherry driven aroma.  Pepper and fenugreek came to mind as the dram took an herbal turn with background notes of salt, leather, and medicinal herbs.  Occasional hits of sulphur and plasticine.  \\n\\n**Palate** : Medium to light body with nice oily viscosity and notes of molasses and dried fruits.  Opened right away with fruit— dried dates, bitter oranges, lime zest, and prunes.  Dry woody notes of antiques accompanied rich molasses which transitioned toward milk chocolate on the back palate.  Pleasant notes of lemon-lime and brown sugar appeared at the end with a subtle tobacco spice. \\n \\n**Finish** :  Lingering dried dates, brown sugar, and mild dryness  \\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Score** : 3  \\n\\n**Mental Image** : Forgotten Jar of Dried Dates  \\n\\n- - -\\n\\n**Notes** : I approached this with the impression that Amrut intended it as a replacement for the excellent, but sadly discontinued, Intermediate Sherry.  That was not really what this was— it was less intense though perhaps a bit more approachable.  \\n\\nIt was hard to ignore the heady hits of sulphur that appeared on the nose.  While they were mercifully missing on the palate, insofar as I really noticed, their aroma proved a bit of a distraction.  This was one of the cases in which I went and looked up other reviews to see if I was the only one a bit disappointed with this release or distracted by sulphur on the nose.  At least in the summer of 2021, whiskybase had several other commentators with very similar reactions to the dram and to impressions of sulphur.  So I do not feel too much out on a limb or in “hot take” land with my thoughts.  \\n\\nOverall, this sherry finished Amrut was interesting, but I felt like something was missing.  The flavor profile was a tad bitter, especially at the finish, and I kept wishing that some of those lemon-lime and brown sugar notes were more prevalent and not just hiding at the end.  I would happily accept a pour of this, but I would not go out of my way.  I remain high on Amrut, but this sherry finished malt was not my favorite.',\n",

Loads of spices (in a good way - more herbal and baking than just plain heat) with some nice peated elements primarily in the form of ash and wood smoke, cut with a bit of sweetness in vanilla and the typical tropical notes that Amrut is known for.

The typical Amrut markers (tropical, cereal, funk) and the unmistakable earthy and spicy Jamaican rum funk wrestle for dominance, with ex-bourbon influenced notes of vanilla and oak initially in the background but picking up steam as time passes as well. Sweet and spicy on the tongue, with some musty oak and earthy rum funk in the background. That spiciness leads into the finish, which contains much of the same elements (bright spice / musty wood / rum funk) from the taste and lingers for awhile afterwards. \\n\\nA weird and funky one here, full flavoured and quite spicy. The various influences in this are quite striking, though clash as often as they mesh together. The Jamaican rum influence is quite direct and packs a punch in here, but the core Amrut style definitely holds its ground as well. Let’s call it a draw, as well as an entertaining experiment.

It reminds me a bit of the first edition of Spectrum with the mix of fruit and spices, especially on the palate.

Full of cherry spread, toasted walnuts, vanilla cream, butterscotch, green bananas, roasted papaya, plum candy, lingering cinnamon and sultana raisins\\n\\n* Taste: Much more rich and spicy then the nose assumes, lots of cherries and black plums, then some silky caramels, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, roasted bananas, coconut milk, toasted treenuts and lingering woodsmoke\\n\\n* Finish: Medium to Long with lasting cooking spices, cinnamon bread, raisins and dark chocolate with some extra green banana and papaya with water added\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nA very interesting cask of Amrut indeed! It reminds me a bit of the first edition of Spectrum with the mix of fruit and spices, especially on the palate. Water seems to calm this whisky down a bit and bring out more oily qualities of the spirit and push the spices on the finish even more as well as adding some raw tropical fruits in the mix as well. Overall, its quite a standout Amrut with some great complexity however I wish it was a tad less hot especially on the mid-palate and finish. Glad I split this one as the value for $180 CAD is very good if you like more oak driven Amrut.\\n\\n86/100',\n",
       " \"Reddit Whiskey Network Review #65\\n\\nReview #9 on r/worldwhisky\\n\\nIndia #2\\n\\n**AMRUT - BLACKADDER RAW CASK - PEATED CASK FINISH**\\n\\n**ABV:** 61.3%\\n\\n**Cask:** BA26 - 2016\\n\\n**Source:** 2 oz sample via r/scotchswap from Secret Santa u/wiggleywig\\n\\nImage from Whiskybase\\n\\n**Background:** First, I have to admit that as a sci-fi and fantasy geek who grew up in late 70's and early 80's playing AD&D, the image Blackadder uses on their packaging evokes a wonderful nostalgia for me. The silhouetted warrior with sword and shield at the ready, stepping out of the swirling mist beneath the stylized black snake and the illuminated B just make my little geek heart smile.\\n\\nThat being said, I try not to fall victim to marketing, and focus just on the juice in the bottle... but I do really like the packaging here!\\n\\n**Tasting methodology:** I pour neat into a Glencairn at room temperature and promptly shove my nose in the glass for a first impression. After a moment I take my first sip, again just looking for first impressions.\\n\\nI then let the glass sit for 10-15 minutes and come back for a more thoughtful examination.\\n\\n**Color:** [   ](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg).\\n\\n**First Impression:** Big ethanol heat on a fresh pour. Sweet nose of smoke with warm bread, malt syrup, molasses, and some nuttiness. Little to no burn on the first sip. Malt, toasted bread, molasses, and a dry earthy peat on the palate. Finish lingers and heats up. Peppery and smoky on the swallow. Rich mouthfeel.\\n\\n**After 15 minutes:** A rest does this a lot of good. No surprise at 60+ % Most of the ethanol has dissipated from the nose leaving lots of “bakery notes”, bread dough, spice cookies, and pastry with hints of malt, cinnamon and vanilla. Peat is more dirty than vegetal, smoke is bonfire coals. Both have backed off from the first sip. Very complementary without being “in your face”\\n\\nPalate leads with sweet malt, those “bakery notes”, and quite a bit of spice. Black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, and mint are all there, transitioning to salted caramel with just a hint of orange peel.\\n\\n**Finish:** The salted caramel lingers quite a bit. Pleasantly long finish that fades to bitter almonds and a whiff of bonfire, with a hint of drying astringency.\\n\\n**Overall:** My second Amrut, and my first Raw Cask. Very very good whisky. More subdued that the Peated CS I reviewed before, but that lets a lot more of the nuance come through. Once again I am very impressed. I want more Amrut. Very enjoyable pour, but I want a bottle I can work through instead of drinking this 2oz at a time out of samples.\\n\\n**Scoring:**\\n- First Impression: 84/100\\n- Nose: 88/100\\n- Palate: 90/100\\n- Finish: 90/100\\n\\n**Final Score: 88/100**\\n\\n**Scoring Interpretation:**\\n\\n- **0-59:** What is this? Yuck! Is this a joke?! Did I lose a bet?!\\n\\n- **60-69:** Meh... glad I tried it so I have the palate experience, but I'm not gonna chase this down again.\\n\\n- **70-79:** Nothing to get overwrought about, but if the price is right, I'd drink this any time.\\n\\n- **80-89:** Fantastic! I want a bottle on my bar all the time.\\n\\n- **90-95:** Truly amazing. A special treat I will savor when I can.\\n\\n- **96-100:** Have yet to taste something I'd rate here. Ever optimistic I guess.\\n\\nThanks for reading. I welcome any feedback you have.\\n\\n~Cheers!\",\n",
       " 'Thanks to /u/wiggleywig for the sample.  This is a NAS Amrut bottled by Blackadder as part of their Raw Cask series.  It was finished in a cask that previously held peated whisky, and released in 2016.  These Raw Cask tend to be pretty good, so hoping this one follows the trend.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Amrut Blackadder Raw Cask Peated Cask Finish BA26/2016, 61.3% ABV, no chill filtration, no color added*\\n\\n* **Color:** Orange gold.\\n* **Nose:** Honeyed malt, citrus, biscuit dough, vanilla, sugar cookies, very slight seaweed.\\n* **Palate:** Malty, some heat, citrus, caramel, creamy, sugar cookie, hint of smoke, charcoal, chili pepper.\\n* **Finish:** Long.  Malt, some smoke, some peat, heat, chili spice, orange peel, charcoal, burnt meat, caramel, bits of sandalwood.\\n\\nThis got better with just a bit of water to help cut through the heat.  This had the traditional Amrut chili pepper I always get, but not nearly as much as in some other releases.  Not too much complexity (probably quite young), but still quite tasty.  The cask influence on the finish is quite fun here, as it starts off quite subtle on the nose and builds to be quite present on the finish.

Here goes.\\n\\n**Amrut cask strength: 61.8% ABV (yikes), natural color, unchillfiltered.**\\n\\n* **Color:** Golden straw\\n\\n* **Nose:** Very alcoholic. Nutty, with a complex mixture of zest and spice.\\n\\n* **Taste neat:** Ethanol. Honestly at this ABV I didn't get much out of it until the finish, which was malty sweet and woody.\\n\\n* **Taste with water:** Mmmmmm, that's better. Fresh fruity sweetness up front, balanced by nuts and oak tannins as it develops. Thick, oily mouthfeel. Misc hard to pin down spices throughout.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Medium length, malty, oaky.\\n\\nI guess I'm not at the point yet where I can fully appreciate a young cask strength whisky straight out of the bottle. Even after adding quite a bit of water I found this to be a fiery, aggressive whisky. There's a lot going on here though; I'd have to say it's one of the most well delineated flavor developments I've experienced, going from fruity-sweet  to spicy-nutty-sweet to to oaky. The flavor is very intense and full. Good stuff.\\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\nEdit: so, I just went to archive and saw this is #20 for me. Level me up!\",\n",

Additionally, I find that drinking other spirits (tequila, cognac, bourbon, etc.) improves my tasting of scotch by exposing myself to varied flavor profiles.  \\n  \\nThe picture in the link is my current selection and I will try to work my way through it over the coming weeks and report back here with my findings…one mustn’t procrastinate.  \\n  \\n  \\n“I swing between procrastination and being really thorough so either way things aren't getting done quickly.”  \\n  \\n-Freema Agyeman  \\n   \\n\\nI will list the changing tastes and smells chronologically rather than strength as to attempt to portray how a dram evolves to me.\\nAtmosphere: Reading Old Man’s War by John Scalzi (reading for the third time now) while listening to Black Pearl by John Coltrane.  \\n  \\n**Color**: Straw yellow, colors of gold and copper highlights as the light hits and moves through  \\n  \\n**Nose**: Buttered biscuit, all spice, underlying ethanol, nutty notes  \\n  \\n**Taste (neat)**: Ethanol hits first, malt, sweet and salt ebbs and flows between sips but never leaves  \\n  \\n**Taste (with water)**: Water improves this for me, brings in butter, all spice, light honey and oak into the mix  \\n  \\n**Finish**: Long, long finish, doesn’t want to end, wash of warmth followed by thick oil, flavors of malt and sweetness are left lingering  \\n  \\nNow for scoring, personally flavor and finish rule over nose and value so I will attempt to take this fact into consideration  \\n  \\n**Nose**: 18/20  \\n  \\n**Taste**: 29/30  \\n  \\n**Finish**: 28/30  \\n  \\n**Value**: 19/20  \\n  \\n**Score**: 94/100  \\n  \\nHow do I sum this up?

       " \"Greetings World Whisky! I've been slack on reviewing world whiskies lately, despite having quite a few to review. Today, that changes (a little)!\\n\\nThese are 2 whiskies from Amrut, the leading Indian whisky distillery in the world. I've tried some of their stuff in the Fusion, and I thought it was excellent. Will these 2 cask strength offerings improve on that?\\n\\nLet's find out!\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Amrut Cask Strength**  \\n*India, 61.8% ABV, NCF, NCA?, €50 for 700ml*\\n\\n**Nose**: Spirity. Malty. Sharp alcohol. Wheat porridge. Sour cranberries. Milk chocolate. Sweet toffee. Golden syrup. Buttery almonds. Mango cakes. \\n\\nThere may be a lot going on here, but the alcohol is the main event. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not completely pleasant either.\\n\\n**Taste**: Sharp alcohol. Bitter grain. Butter. Barley malt. Almonds. Light white wine. Pineapple. Canteloupe.\\n\\nVery sharp alcohol and a light bitterness that I'm not a fan of. Over a period of an hour it smooths out and becomes sweeter.\\n\\n**Finish**: Long. Spirity. Bitter grain husks. Milk chocolate. Young. Pineapple and canteloupe.\\n\\nToo young, too spirity, too unfinished. Some good elements, but definitely a bit harsh.\\n\\n**Summary**: With Scotch, you'd generally say that this would be great in 5 years, but considering it's probably under 3 years old, I don't know what the equivalent would be. A few months, a year? Who knows. Regardless, I'm not a huge fan of this. \\n\\nThe distillate tastes alright, but it's just not what I mainly want to taste. After about an hour of airing, it tastes pretty good, but I don't want to air out my whisky for an hour every time.\\n\\nCompared to something similar like Glenmorangie Astar, this definitely loses out on the softness. If you want a raw, unbridled whisky, though, this is pretty ace.\\n\\n**Score**: 83/100  \\n*A few degrees from greatness.*\\n\\n**Most Similar To**: Glenmorangie Astar, highland ex-bourbon CS single malts (Glen Garioch, Glenrothes, Glenturret, etc.).\\n\\n**Buy Again?** No. I never find myself reaching for the bottle.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Amrut Peated Cask Strength**  \\n*India, 62.8% ABV, NCF, NCA?, €50 for 700ml*\\n\\n**Nose**: Soft. Bananas. Supple smokiness. Toffee. Raspberry candy, gummy worms. Lightly harsh alcohol.\\n\\nYummy. Candied smoke throughout. I really like this as a sweeter and not salty peated malt.\\n\\n**Taste**: Prickly mouthfeel. Raspberries. Candy cane. Sweet wood smoke. Lightly buttery malt. Toffee apples. \\n\\nJust amazing. Lovely sweetness and smokiness really play off each other here. It's not peaty or boggy, just smoky and gorgeous.\\n\\n**Finish**: Lengthy. Sweet. Raspberries. Sweet oak. Malt extract. Dusty oak.\\n\\nContinues with the good stuff. Still very young, but not excessively spirity.\\n\\n**Summary**: The TL;DR of this pair of reviews is the photograph of the levels of these two bottles. I bought both at the same time, but I've never found myself reaching for the standard Amrut CS bottle, while the Peated CS is a completely different story.\\n\\nThis is just a very good, completely unique peated malt. It's kind of like Kilchoman in its sweetness and soft peatiness, but the sweetness is amped up by a huge amount. It really is just an excellent whisky, and it's not one that I'd ever refuse to drink.\\n\\nIs it worth the price premium over the Fusion? Well, that's a different question since they're both roughly the same malt and the Fusion is about half the price. I personally don't think the extra 12.8% is worth the money, but you may.\\n\\n**Score**: 94/100  \\n*Fantastic.*\\n\\n**Most Similar To**: Amrut Fusion, Kilchoman 100% Islay.\\n\\n**Buy Again?** Yes. Well, the Fusion at the very least.\",\n",

This is my sixth mystery dram from my secret santa /u/Scotch_Fanatic and it came with the clue “being slapped by barley” anyway here goes:\\n\\n**Colour:** straw gold  \\n\\n**Nose:** Honestly it led with a sharp alcohol that was a bit of a shock at first, so I returned to it for a second sniff with more caution. Then I could smell the barley malt and grain, it smelt like bread. Behind the bread were some tart berries, toffee and a hint of milk chocolate.  \\n\\n**Palette:** Again the alcohol was a fairly big player here , but still alongside an awful lot of maltiness and barley, tucked away in the shadows of the barley and alcohol was a nice floral white wine aroma with melon and a little nuttiness. Some lovely caramel and vanilla in there too.  \\n\\n**Finish:** long and warming, the caramel is there and there’s just a little spiciness to it also, and some soft milk chocolate there as well. Travels right down the throat with its warming prowess.   \\n\\n**Conclusions:** I thought it was quite a nice dram, I’m not usually one to shy away from alcohol but it was just a little too harsh for me, it seems like it could do with a few years in a barrel just to let it mellow out a little. Once I’d gotten over the alcohol it seemed a very well balanced dram and the finish was really quite excellent. So guessing-wise there’s not an awful lot I can do but I’d say it’s cask strength and young.\\n',\n",

I've only had the Amrut Fusion in terms of their lineup, but it was a couple years ago, and I don't really recall what I thought. This is bottled at 61.8% and it's NAS but rumored to be between 4-5 years old. \\n\\n**Nose** Caramelized, sweet oak with a somewhat acrid note. Slight isopropyl note buried beneath a huge wave of malt which carries a slightly smoky note. The malt profile strikes me as being very similar to an Irish whisky.\\n\\n**Mouthfeel** Oily & full\\n\\n**Palate** Earthy malt with a heavy dose of dry oak and hay.

       " '**Amrut Single Malt Whisky** (*Single Malt, Indian, 5cl, 46% ABV, NAS, Batch No. 39, Bottled Feb 2012*)\\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $11.46 CAD\\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (neat!) and comes in a miniature canister as well.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -1.\\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  It begins peppery, hot and youthful. Very sweet, molasses, honey, aloe vera, burlap sack, oak tannins in the background. Vanilla pod, heavy cream, almost like frosting. The heat wanes and a spice melange forms with time, lily pads (like… you’d find on a lake… with frogs and such), brie, white pepper, [‘70s era Old Spice after shave]( http://i.imgur.com/YTP1rG4.jpg), peach syrup, pencil shavings, teddy bear fur, and more aloe vera.\\n\\n**Palate**:  Barley-forward. Vanilla, white pepper, butter (ghee?), raw sugar (jaggery goor?), slight hint of pear. With time it opens up into a greater mixture of spices, candle wax, the backing on lickable stamps, cotton, lemon pith, and a sort of Fisherman’s Friend taste—eucalyptus I suppose. It’s quite well balanced and put together.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sour and citric, warming, after a while hazelnuts, French praline, cashews, green apple, pear returns—it’s halfway between cloyingly sweet and tart. Very nice. After allowing the whisky to open up for a bit the finish becomes all wax—crayons more than candles, graphite, pencil shavings and lickable stamps. It then gets b-i-t-t-e-r. Very different. I quite like it.\\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. Only downside was the screwcap wouldn’t come loose of the bit that is supposed to stay on the neck of the bottle—I nearly broke the cap trying to remove it. :/\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  At first it tasted like single malt whisky aged in an ex-bourbon cask. Not that different from anything else I’ve had, closest perhaps in character to Bruichladdich, although a bit sweeter. After a while, however, it really opened up into a bizarre combination of scents and flavours from my childhood crossed with chemicals and industrial solvents. I don’t know why, but I really dig it. Perhaps because it’s so different. It’s very easy drinking—blind I would never guess it was 46%—and I’m quite looking forward to trying the Cask Strength and Fusion miniatures that I picked up at the same time (as well as a full-sized bottle of something else in the future).\\n\\n\\n**85/100**.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Amrut Cask Strength** (*Single Malt, Indian, 5cl, 61.8% ABV, NAS, Batch No. 13, Bottled Jan 2012*)\\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $11.46 CAD\\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (woo) and comes in a miniature canister as well. Due to the ludicrously high ABV, I reviewed this at an **adjusted 46%** after adding water. Elsewise the review notes all consisted of “ow”, “ouch”, and “my god it burns”. Does this negate the point of the review? Will it be exactly the same as the normal 46% ABV Amrut offering? Read on to find out.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -2.\\n\\n**Nose**:  Heavy-handed spices, very reminiscent of rye whisky. Cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, vanilla pod, and an underlying saccharine sweetness. With time the sweetness is identifiable as raw sugar (jaggery goor) crossed with coconut, and there are notes of toasted sesame seeds, grapeseed oil and a hint of smoke and cheese.\\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Warming, spiced, pleasant—this isn’t as hot as the basic Amrut single malt with the added water, even though they’re the same ABV. Burlap notes, rice vinegar, soybean and tapioca come to the fore. With time it opens up into white pepper, dried apricot, pears in syrup, and becomes rather barley forward just like its standard 46% cousin. Notes of toasted walnuts appear, as the spice melange continues to change—leaning more towards oak spice than rye-ish spice.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Long, oaky, slightly smoky. Very, *very* pleasant, but not very complex at first. Opens up into a nice citric note which is simultaneously sour and bitter, but in all the right ways. Ends with soya sauce, tamarind paste and the lingering bite of everlasting oak. With time in the glass the finish transforms completely, becoming very sweet and more like the lickable backs of stamps as found in the standard 46% offering’s palate, but with unsalted pistachios, soybean, toasted sesame and even more puckeringly tannic oak. \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. I’m getting tired of removing tax stamps though. Not sure why I was so enamored with them before.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Well, if you dilute it to 46% ABV it’s similar to the standard release of Amrut Single Malt Whisky—but a much, much better version of it. It’s more balanced, but that could very well be due to this being from a better batch of casks. I’d place this one head and shoulders above the standard Amrut offering, but drinking it at 61.8% is a silly idea. I might try 50-55% and add that as an addendum to this review, but without that this stands at:  \\n\\n\\n**87/100**.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion** (*Single Malt, Indian, 5cl, 50% ABV, NAS, Batch No. 22, Bottled Sept 2012*)\\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $11.46 CAD\\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (ugh) and comes in a miniature canister as well.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +1.\\n\\n**Nose**:  Oh, my word—this is lovely stuff. If nosed immediately after pouring (or from the bottle) there’s a surge of phenols and peat smoke, but after sitting in the glass for a few minutes it recedes and distillery character takes centre stage: Dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark rum, figs, graham crackers, garam masala—cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, specifically. Amrut’s saccharine sweetness has turned treacle, as everything about this whisky is just darker than its brethren. With water it becomes a lovely gently peated dram, plenty of graham crackers, gingerbread, lovely soft pastry notes and peat. \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Pickling spice, peat smoke, oak, spice increases but the pickled bit recedes—a cross of oak influence and distillery character with cinnamon, white pepper, soybean and vanilla pod. It’s hot and youthful but it doesn’t go too far. It’s quite tart and has just the right amount of prickliness—especially when paired with the peat. With water it’s much less intense: citrus, barley sugar, gentle peat smoke, oak spice and tannins. Wonderfully sour.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Peat smoke, oak, pickle brine, vinegar, soya sauce and a spice melange. After time it progresses into something very tannic and somewhat bitter. Eventually it turns into sweet territory with caramel and pralines surrounded by subtle drawn-out peat smoke. With water… there’s nothing remarkable. It’s weak, largely non-existent.\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. The cap on this one was hard to remove, nearly broke in the process, and I really do hate tax stamps. Such a pain to remove cleanly.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  This offering is quite different from standard Amrut releases, and the distillery character is subsumed by the peated spirit. I like the whisky just fine, but I can’t help but feel that peat didn’t offer any real improvement over the base offering—it’s a bluntly implemented flavour, and doesn’t blend harmoniously with Amrut’s usual characteristics. It noses amazingly, it tastes very nice, the finish is so-so on it, and it absolutely lacks balance. So slight docking of marks for those issues. Still a wonderful whisky, but could be better if it were wholly peated spirit, and not a mix of both styles. (I’m aware that exists. Perhaps I’ll have to try it.)  \\n\\n\\n**83/100**.',\n",

       " \"End of the Year Review #4: Amrut Single Malt – Cask Strength\\n\\nMy final year-end review is for a whisky coming from India. Amrut has been around since the 1940's but just spread to Europe in the 1990's and launched in America in 2010. I have liked everything I have had from them, Fusion being absolutely wonderful, but I will be reviewing the Cask Strength. Amrut has no age statement, and it is a bit of a mystery, but the general consensus is they figured out a way to put this out in under 4 years. \\n\\nThis is the second consecutive heavyweight I am reviewing, coming in at 61.8% ABV. This really helps accentuate the big bright flavors found in this dram. The nose is rich with honey and malt and slight traces of vanilla and grassy pasture. The palate is dominated by malted barley, a strait forward example of what a malt whisky is without sherry, peat, or other influence. There is a slight tingle of ethanol (coming from the high proof) and subtle spice, and a very pleasing warmth. Long finish, slightly sweet, and ever present malt.\\n\\nMuch like the Four Roses Small Batch, this doesn't get many points for complexity, but makes up for it in richness. Despite the short aging, Amrut delivers like any 10-12 year Scotch would and could hold it's own in a side by side with any of Scotland's best offerings. **91/100**\\n\\nA quick side note, I have always drank whiskey neat, with no water added. It's been a while doing it just that way so I have been trying a splash of water again here and there. Water turned this dram into and over-oaked mess, would not recommend.\\n\\n*Follow me at www.facebook.com/grainsofwrathwhiskeyblog & check out http://alcoholmanac.com/index.php/blogs/77-grains-of-wrath*\\n\\n*Clicks on my blog don't get me money but help me get free bottles to review!*\",\n",
       " 'AMRUT ~~VERTICAL~~ HORIZONTAL (thanks, Loweeel)\\n\\nAmrut was my first world whisky.  I tried the Fusion in a bar several years ago, specifically because I’d never had an Indian whisky before and I wanted to give it a shot – and boy am I glad I did!  I had a bunch of minis and samples around, so one night I decided to treat myself and do a nice, side-by-side review of some of their offerings.\\n\\n**Single Malt Cask Strength** (Batch #18, 61.8%)\\n\\nSome people get watches when they graduate college.  When I graduated in December, my reward to myself was a trip to The Party Source in Cincinnati.  It is a pilgrimage that all whisky nerds in the region should make!  I picked up a number of awesome whiskies, plus two Amrut minis – this one, and the Amrut peated which is reviewed below.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tangy honey and tropical fruit.  A tad oily.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Honey, vanilla and malt in a big way!  Honey lingers in the finish.  There is a distinct savory-ness to it, almost like a white whisky but not funky.  This is NOT a light whisky – heavy and oily.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Oily malt and vanilla take over.  More akin to a highland scotch now.  Molasses.  I also got a hint of Luxardo, which is quite interesting!\\n\\n*Taste:*  Malt and vanilla and some oiliness.  Wonderful balance of flavors.  Not too sweet, but certainly sweet.\\n\\n87/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  This is a delicious and complex whisky, and a great option if you want a neat variation on the bourbon-matured, highland scotch style.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Fusion** (50%)\\n\\nAs I said in the intro, this was my first world whisky, and to date it is the only Amrut I have bought a full bottle of.  I do want to note, though, that this bottle was open for close to a year and a half by the time I got around to reviewing it.  I transferred it to smaller bottles several times to prevent oxidation, but some was inevitable.  I imagine if I had a new bottle, the peat would stand out a bit more.  At any rate…\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tropical fruit.  Light peat smoke. Molasses.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Sweet and savory malt with light smokiness.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Molasses!  Soft vanilla malt.\\n\\n*Taste:*  A slightly savory – but NOT oily – malt.\\n\\n85/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  Really interesting stuff here.  I am still kicking myself that I didn’t pick up a few more when the PLCB put this on closeout last year.  $46 a bottle.  What could have been…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Peated** (Batch #10, 46%)\\n\\nOnce again, I picked this up at The Party Source in December.  Nothing else to see here.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Surprisingly light peat.  Tangy fruit.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Oily phenols and burnt rubber (in a good way) fade into lovely fruity malt.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Smoke subsides, but fruit and spice linger.  Cinnamon and molasses.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Peat is assertive, but sweet.  Lingers much longer into the finish.  Tangy fruit.\\n\\n83/100\\n\\n(*) - Try it.  Good quality, interesting, but not mind blowing.  It’s not going to replace the Ardbeg or Laphroaig on your shelf, but it is worth investigating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Blackadder Peated Rawcask** (62.7%, bottled 6/12)\\n\\nThis one has a story.  My final project for my chemistry major was an analysis of phenols in peated whisky, and it just so happens that a man who imports a number of spirit brands into the US (among them, Amrut and Blackadder) lives in my home town.  I got in touch with him to see if I could get some samples for the project, and he donated a number of whiskies.  The prize among them was this – an independently bottled, cask strength, unfiltered, peated Amrut.  I wan’t even aware that IB Amruts existed before I had the sample in my hands.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Sweet orange.  Earthy peat.  Difficult to get past the alcohol.\\n\\n*Taste:*  ALCOHOL.  Big peat.  Orange, again; I’ve tasted a similar note in Smith & Cross rum.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Citrus fruit.  Beautiful peated malt; sweet and fruity.  Amazing.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Boy howdy… luscious, fruity, peated malt.  Fruity without the sweetness you get from certain Islay whiskies – Laphroaig and Ardbeg come to mind.\\n\\n\\nNow, with that, I could have said OK, done for the day – but I had a feeling I could get more out of this one.  So, a few days later, I poured another glass, watered it to about 50%, covered it and let it sit for a good long time (I can’t recall how long exactly, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was an hour or two).  The result:\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tropical fruits.  Faint, faint peat smoke.  There’s a oiliness that is competeing with the overall sweetness of it.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Oh boy.  Peat. Peat peat peat.  A brief initial sweetness with tangy malt and fruit.  Reminds me of an Ardbeg, but with a more reserved sweetness.  This can go head to head with Islay any day of the week.  Saline and oily, in a good way – like a rich dessert.  Heavy.  You really can’t rush this one… it demands you drink it slowly.\\n\\n90/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  Good luck finding this one in the wild, but if you see it, buy it.  Do not hesitate.  At the same time though, I wouldn’t necessarily go out of my way to hunt one down as some would with a limited release bourbon.  Blackadder bottles a damn good whisky, and while this was excellent – by far the best Amrut I’ve had – this was NOT the best Blackadder I’ve had.  All in all I am incredibly thankful I got to try this one; this is a unicorn whisky if there ever was one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion:  Amrut is a damn good distillery.  From these notes, I’d say that the defining character of an Amrut whisky is tropical fruit notes and a decided oily, heavy body.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\nEDIT: Formatting',\n",
       " \"Today is the day I get my Indian flag.  And since the previous 8 Indian whiskies I've reviewed have all been from Amrut, I figure what's two more, right?  And instead of doing some of their crazy, experimental, off the wall releases, I'm doing the standard cask strength, and the peated cask strength.  Let's see what that Amrut distillate does on its own.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Amrut Cask Strength, 61.8% ABV, no chill filtration, no color added*\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep amber.\\n* **Nose:** Pear, malt, cereal, chili pepper, peach, honeycomb, coconut, butterscotch, vanilla.\\n* **Palate:** A bit hot.  Malt, apricot, chili pepper, honey, butterscotch, coconut, vanilla.\\n* **Finish:** Long and warm.  Honey, cereal, malt, butterscotch, vanilla, a bit of apple.\\n\\nThis was great!  I'm sure it's young, as it's Amrut, but it doesn't taste young at all.  Gotta love that hot Indian climate.  Lots of great tasty bourbon notes.  And the Amrut character is still very present here.  Full of flavor.  Needed surprisingly little water for the proof.\\n\\n**90/100**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Amrut Peated Cask Strength, 62.8% ABV, no chill filtration, no color added*\\n\\n* **Color:** Amber, lighter than the unpeated version.\\n* **Nose:** Clean smoke, malt, cereal, apple, vanilla.\\n* **Palate:** Apple, malt, smoke, bbq, vanilla, a bit spicy, peach.\\n* **Finish:** BBQ, apple, peach, smoke, butterscotch, banilla, ash, bell pepper.\\n\\nThis was good, but it suffered because I'm comparing it directly with the unpeated version.  Surprisingly, this was less flavorful and thinner than the unpeated, despite being 1% higher ABV.  Considering that it tasted less flavorful, and also noticing the color difference, I can't help but wonder if this is a bit younger.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*World Whisky Reviews #47-48*\\n\\n*Indian Whisky Reviews #9-10*\\n\\n*Whisky Network Reviews #139-140*\",\n",

Seriously great people over there.\\n\\nOne of my most recent swaps was with an awesome person named /u/pacifen, and seriously, this was a pretty great swap. I\\'ve been jonesing to try different types of world whisky, and unfortunately (as everyone is sick of hearing), Ontario decides to throw curve balls on some non-European world whiskies. And by curve balls, I mean price hikes and random intervals of availability (can you tell I work in Marketing... god, I nearly made myself sick with that last line).\\n\\nAlso, who wants to only drink Irish and Canadian. If you do that, you end up bitter and disinterested like Texacer.\\n\\nNone the less, that\\'s where the awesome pacifen comes in. In our swap I received quite a few world whiskies, and the first I couldn\\'t hold off reviewing was the **Amrut Cask Strength**.\\n\\nSpoiler: Whatever they are doing over at Amrut Distilleries is amazing and should be praised. This is some wicked good stuff. Turns out they have been around since 1948, and yet we\\'re only now hearing about their amazing stuff.\\n\\nHere\\'s hoping the LCBO can buy some more of their offerings (or at least the Peated, as I\\'m interested in that one).\\n\\n**Region:** Indian\\n\\n**Abv:** 61.8%\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Ontario :(\\n\\n**Colour:** Nutmeg\\n\\n**Nose:** Smoke, alcohol, lilac, vanilla, nutmeg, cardamon, sourdough, orange rind, chocolate\\n\\nIt\\'s like an Irish, a great Lowland, a good Highland, and a really good Cambelton got together brought the best out of each one.

The alcohol portion is a tad strong, however that subsides as you drink more. And you\\'ll want to drink more.\\n\\n**Taste:** Smooth, lime, flowers, heat, smoke, bacon, nutmeg, cinnamon, peanuts, licorice, toffee, honey\\n\\nVery complex taste. Starting out the smoke and lime are in the background for me, and it resembles a weak Cambelton, however as time goes on it really blossoms into an amazing flavour.\\n\\nI should note that the website originally noted a buttery flavour, however I didn\\'t. But that\\'s been something I\\'ve been noting that I have a hard time determining. Buttery flavours, that is, not the website.\\n\\n**Finish:** Nutmeg, smoke, walnut, faint orange, anise, yeast, pencil shavings, chili flakes, earthy, marjoram, coffee\\n\\nIn the finish is where I\"m starting to get the Indian flavours come out, with the marjoram being center stage, as well as more spice. Long finish on this one, and it\\'s nice to be able to taste walnuts without my tongue swelling up.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** From now you can tell I liked this one, what with the way I\\'ve gushed over it, however I think where it \"falls short\" is the Finish being the only part that has a terroir portion to it. And not that it\\'s bad, it just really borrows from other areas. Is that bad? Not completely, I think this tasted amazing, and would buy a bottle if I could. However I wanted something more unique. And honestly I\\'m nitpicking, I\\'m just saying there\\'s room for more improvement, and perhaps I\\'ll find that in their other varieties.\\n\\nMaybe I have become disinterested and bitter?\\n\\n**84/100**\\n\\n*Review #17, Indian Whisky #2*',\n",

It’s some of the oldest whisky the company has bottled so far, only being eclipsed by the Greedy Angles (I think). The first release had to be proofed down from nearly 70% abv, so I’m imagining this required quite a bit of water as well. I’ll let you get a few other details behind this bottle from [/u/Devoz ‘s original post](https://redd.it/5jhe9n), it’s a good read not just for the bottle details.

With air the flavors deepen a bit, taking on an aged rye spice note - allspice with a little cinnamon.\\n* **Palate:** A bit hot for the proof and age; thick and viscous mouthfeel. Minty-spice, oak, flat caramel. More baking spice, grapefruit, and that unmistakable Amrut profile (reminds me of Fusion, a bit).\\n* **Finish:** Some ginger comes through here, mixed with that Amrut malt note, but otherwise it’s still spice-forward.\\n* **Thoughts:** Continuing the palate notes, this is like a richer, more complex Fusion. The mouthfeel is amazing (though the level of heat & spice is surprising). It’s an odd combination – I’d even say more unconventional than Amrut Rye. This is like a speyside/rye blend with a mix of light fruit and spice.

Or rather, it's like cake on top of cake. With more cake.\\n\\nDamn I need to stop eating cake.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, this is different than multiple finished whiskies. It's closer to a Canadian method of aging each component separately and then mixing them. Which I'm pretty sure isn't a Canadian idea at all, we just do it every so often.\\n\\nSo let's see how this tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** N/A in Canada\\n\\n**Region:** India\\n\\n**Cask No. / Cask Type:** 3451 (Ex-Bourbon) / 3802 (PX Sherry)\\n\\n**Date of Filling:** June 2009 / May 2010\\n\\n**Malt Type:** Unpeated Indian Barley\\n\\n**Date of Bottling:** August 2016\\n\\n**Abv:** 46%\\n\\n**Colour:** 10YR 6/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Chocolate, cigarettes, ash, sunflowers, currant, raisins\\n\\nInitially I'd say the ex-Sherry cask is stronger here. Lots of chocolate notes. Good amount of ash in there too. Really dark chocolate notes. And dark fruits. Just all dark, really. \\n\\nI'm saying this has a nose like someone fucking their way across Africa. In all the best ways, and without the high risk of AIDS.\\n\\n**Taste:** Ash, peach, brown sugar, raisin, malt\\n\\nMore ash, however the fruit elements and big malt. Still has a big fruit element to all of it. Good rich flavours.\\n\\nI was hoping some vanilla elements would pop in from the ex-Bourbon cask. Was hoping that would give it a huge rum cake flavour, but that's lacking.\\n\\n**Finish:** Ginger, raisin, plum, salt, chocolate, brown sugar, sugared lemon peel\\n\\nFinish is really what you drink this for. The ex-bourbon cask is again missing, though I'm starting to think it adds sweet to the sherry cask bitter, earth notes. More chocolate, lots of flavours, and really long finish.\\n\\nGiven time it starts to have more acidity. Wish there was even more of this.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** This is liquid chocolate malt. If you threw it in a blender, I'd say it's become a horrible mess. Or a chocolate milkshake. Probably more likely the first.\\n\\nThis is super sweet, has lots of chocolate and dark fruit flavours, and a good amount of spice. It has developed quite well compared to other Amrut Sherry casks (of which there are many).\\n\\nThat said, I just don't get enough ex-bourbon in here. I want more. It sets me up to think there's going to be more, and that side of it doesn't deliver. The taste is hurt by it. The finish is really nice, but end of the day it comes off as a sherried dram.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky review #190, India review #25, Whisky Network review #896*\\n\\n*1001 Whiskies You Must Taste Before You Die review #311*\\n\\n*Other Amrut reviews:*\\n\\n* [Amrut 10 Greedy Angels](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5j636w/amrut_10_greedy_angels_review/)\\n\\n* [Amrut Bangalore Tiger Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1fuxdh/amrut_cask_strength_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Ex-Bourbon Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Fusion](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1g1jb1/amrut_fusion_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Indian Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Kadhambam No. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Naarangi](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Blackadder Raw Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1mrvhb/amrut_peated_cask_strengthreview/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Port Pipe Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Portonova](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut PX Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Rye](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5niz2b/amrut_rye_review/)\\n\\n* [Amrut Spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Two Continents (2nd Release)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)\",\n",

Thanks dude!\\n\\nThis is a double-cask bottling, in which both casks are heavily peated, but one’s a port pipe. Neat! I’ve enjoyed my peated-port Amrut experiences so far, let’s see how this one measures up.\\n \\n***\\n\\n**Amrut Double Cask (Peated Bourbon/Peated Port).** Indian single malt. 46% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Local Price:** Not available in Ontario. I think this sold for about $190 CAD in Alberta.\\n\\n**Barrels:** A vatting of two casks, both filled with spirit made from peated Scottish barley. Cask #3190, distilled May 2012, was a bourbon barrel, and cask #2716, distilled March 2012, was a port pipe. The casks were vatted together and bottled June 2017 at 5 years old. \\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Enjoyed with friends.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Nose:**  Syrupy port and spicy peat. Flamed orange peel, grapefruit, cherries, banana, kiwi, pineapple, and honey. Smoked brisket, black olives, torched cedar planks, and some grilled carrots. Some sweet vanilla, cinnamon, sweet cereals, and a tingle of black pepper. \\n\\n**Palate:** Medium-thick texture. Lots of smoked meat, along with sweet syrupy fruit. Fragrant wood, brown sugar, and cinnamon in the middle. Tropical all of a sudden: fragrant coconut, pineapple, and lemongrass. Black pepper and herbs. A big pickled ginger hit towards the back. \\n\\n**Finish:** Sweet and sour. Honey-glazed smoked meat and plum sauce, with banana, cherries, and grapefruit. Dead leaves and earth. It turns more floral with time. A bit of salt. \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Notes:** Tasty and interesting! I like those brisket-y and cedar notes quite a lot, and the port adds this nice sweetness that feels very integrated. While it’s good now, I feel like this would have been way, way better at cask strength. I really don’t know why they wanted to bottle this one at 46%. Especially for $200. \\n\\n\\n**Final score:  82/100**\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.\\n\\n60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Meh. It’s definitely drinkable, but can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.\\n\\n80-84: Really quite good.

       " \"Fusion\\n$70 50% ABV\\n\\n**Color**:  Light amber, orange and pink.\\n\\n**Nose**:  Peat is the immediate element, but it's not very intense.  Some brine, a bit of smoked pork, and salt.  Buried under these Islay-ish notes are some fruit and oak, but they are diminished.  When I first cracked this I had a sad, since I really dislike peat bombs, but for those who enjoy peat, this nose should be a wonder.  However… let it sit.  The peat settles, and it becomes much more balanced as time progresses.  Very nuanced.\\n\\n**Taste**: Incredible.  Every taste wrenches an emotional response.  There is a light sweetness that hits first, followed by a lush, grassy and woody smoke.  In the sweetness, I sense a touch of apple or pear, but by the time I can detect anything it is then washed over with smoke and wood.\\n\\n**Finish**:  Long.  Quite long.  Peat smoke seems to bookend the sensation that is this single malt, with a more grain and wood heavy middle.  A bit of a lush sweet grassy flavor lingers as well.  Fantastic\\n\\nI've been reading a lot about Amrut here and in other places.  I jumped on the Fusion a couple weeks ago and loved it so much I nearly drank a third of the bottle the first night.  Nosing it and caressing it like it was some adorable, lovable pet that kept me warm.  I hadn't had a whisky that astonishing and addictive since getting a Glendronach 15 year Revival for the first time.  Holy wow this dram was a revelation.  I anticipate the Fusion being a regular sipper, and considering the price is quite reasonable for the quality, I'll be buying it regularly.\\n\\n**93**/100\\n\\nPortonova \\n$115 62.1% ABV\\n\\n**Color**: A nice rich amber, lighter mahogany\\n\\n**Nose**: Lots going on here.  Fruits are apparent with raisins, figs, dates and pears.  Some spices like cinnamon, a little bit of chocolate.  Licorice and nuts.  A bit of smoke and salted butter.  Decadent.  Changes over time and with bit of water.  More of the salty savory components come to the fore.\\n\\n**Taste**: This is 124 proof?  Holy shit.  Really lovely body, the cinnamon and raisins are apparent along with some smoke and savory components.  There is indeed a little burn, but it appears more on the periphery of my mouth, with very little in the back of the throat.  With a dash of water it opens up some, and is decadently smooth.  Definitely taste more smoked meat along with the nutty raisins.  \\n\\n**Finish**: Salted nuts and the core raisin/cinnamon combination.  Some flavors on the finish make me recall Four Roses.  Stays for a good time and then trails off into a spicy fruity haze.\\n\\nWhen I found out the Portonova was available near me, especially after how much I adored the Fusion, I jumped… I'd been disappointed with at least one port finished Scotch, but this is just incredible.

It’s bottled at 50% abv and according to The Whisky Exchange “Amrut Fusion is created from a mix of 75% unpeated Indian barley and 25% peated Scottish barley.

Some good fruit mixed in there that make me think of jam and toast.  Little bit of pineapple.  The peat is really gentle.  I kind of want more of it.\\n\\n* **Finish:** short/medium-short and a bit too hot.  Pepper jelly, oak, cinnamon, orange, wood smoke.     \\n\\n**Thoughts:** It’s a nice whisky to have around, but a bit too pricey for what it is.  A good mix of spices and fruits that are sort of undercut by the heat and body.  I used to reach for it much more often when my collection was smaller, but I usually can find something that hits a specific note better.  It’s fruity, but not like a sherry bomb or speyside fruitbasket.  It’s got peat, but it’s not gonna scratch that itch like most Islays can.  It’s got spice and oak, but I can drink a bourbon/rye for half the price if that’s my bag.

       " \"**Whisky Network Review #68**\\n\\n\\nFusion is one of Amrut’s more popular entry-level single malts.  Unusually, it is a mixture of 25% peated Scottish barley and 75% unpeated Indian malt (both distilled independently). The combined product was then matured in a combination of new and used American oak barrels at the Amrut distillery in Bangalore. As a result, you can expect a lightly-peated malt whisky – but one with many of the “tropical” fruit flavours common to Indian whisky.\\n\\n\\nWhile I'm a big fan of the high-end Amruts ([Spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/59ve0n/ww_review_32_amrut_spectrum/), [Portonova](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5lasj3/ww_review_36_amrut_portonova/), [Intermediate Sherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/567y4e/ww_review_29_amrut_intermediate_sherry/), etc.), my initial exposure was to their basic Indian Single Malt expression – which I thought was terrible.  Composed of pure Indian barley matured in a mix of new and old American oak, it came out way too sweet, almost like a banana liqueur. So I was naturally curious as to how the Fusion would compare.\\n\\n\\nI obtained a Fusion sample through a swap with /u/89Justin. Currently goes for $86 CAD at the LCBO.\\n\\n\\n**Nose**: Red-skinned fruits, especially currants and plum, followed by tropical banana, pineapple, and guava. Definite smoke, but more campfire-style than peaty. Vanilla and brown sugar. Malty, with a faint yeasty smell.  Also a touch of glue, unfortunately.  Definitely distinctive, a nice mix of aromas.\\n\\n\\n**Palate**: Red fruits again, and some citrus now (orange especially). The caramel and vanilla pick up, as do the classic rye baking spices (especially all spice). Some tongue tingle and a bit of burn (likely due to the 50% ABV). Smoke is still there, and complimented by some dry peat. Slightly oily mouthfeel, with a good substantial weight.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**: Fairly long. Lingering orange and berry sweetness, plus some artificial sweetness (banana candies?). Otherwise, lots of extinguished smoke on the way out, which makes for a nice finish.\\n\\n\\nThis was a pleasant surprise after the entry-level Amrut Indian Single Malt.  While I get the same tropical fruit notes here (especially banana), they are not as overwhelming. Given that Fusion is typically only typically ~$10 more, I strongly recommend you skip right over to this one.\\n\\n\\nIn some ways, Fusion reminds me of a tropical fruit version of Highland Park – lightly peated, with loads of fruit flavour. It is probably a bit sweeter up front, and the character of the peat is bit different, but I expect fans of the classic HP style would appreciate this Indian malt as well.

Maybe it is the higher alcohol content (50%) but my mouth feels slightly numb after drinking this, sort of the feeling of the cream the dentist gives before a needle.\\n\\nFor those of you out there unaware of Amrut, they are quickly becoming a well know distillery from India.  There is no age statement on this bottle, or the cask strength (these are the only two I own to check) so I believe it is fairly young.  Amrut Fusion contains two types of barley, one from the 'feet of the great Himalayas' and one being a peated barley from Scotland.  The distilled mash is then aged in fresh oak barrels giving almost a raw sweet oak taste with a spicy finish.  I'd recommend the cask strength over the fusion, but it is a very nice drink. 89/100.\",\n",
       " \"Greetings WorldWhisky! I meant to get an Amrut Fusion for the community review a few months ago, but then didn't order in time and it ended up arriving several weeks late. Regardless, I have a bottle now and it's my first taste of Amrut.\\n\\nAmrut's got a lot of hype recently - does it live up to its reputation as a potential competitor for Scotch? \\n\\nLet's find out!\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion**  \\n*India, 50% ABV, NCF, no E150?, €33 for 700ml*\\n\\n**Nose**: Smoke. Treacle and malt. Cumin and turmeric. Citrus, clementine. Toffee. \\n\\nHonestly, this is really hard to put into words. It's really obviously not Scotch, but if it was I'd put it closest to something like Benromach. It's a very unique and wonderful nose.\\n\\n**Taste**: Wood smoke. Malt and toffee. Light bitterness. Not vanilla... custard. Hard candy. Mango. Cardamom, maybe cumin. Wood, cedar?\\n\\nAs on the nose, this is hard to describe. I know I wrote smoke first, but that's mainly because it's the most obviously recognizable. The rest of this is enigmatic - not at all what you expect from a whisky. \\n\\n**Finish**: Medium length. Molasses. Wood smoke. Mango and lychee. Cardamom. Cedar? Strawberry candy. \\n\\nContinues with its weirdness (and greatness). Tropical fruits, smoke and wood integrate very, very nicely. \\n\\n**Summary**: Deliciously weird. I don't know what it is that Amrut is doing to these Scottish peated malts that they're importing, because this is really, really good. And very different! \\n\\nSo yeah, I'll hop on the hype train as well - Amrut is really good. Apart from Benri...nevermind, this is the biggest revelation I've had with whisky in quite a long time. \\n\\n**Score**: 89/100  \\n*Excellent.*\\n\\n**Buy Again?** For the price, there's almost no competition. So yes.\",\n",

If there is only one complaint I have it, is that the nose is a little too subtle. Otherwise, this is one of the most well-balanced whiskeys I’ve tasted, firing on all cylinders in all three aspects of the experience.

Actually, I wanted to wave in some clever Foster quotes and lots of pomp and circumstances, but I'm afraid, I'm too lazy or too confused like Godbole...Anyway, this sample was swapped to me with /u/SparkTrader – fittingly enough as he is a British man in a country god seem to have forgotten.

Funnily enough, I also get some Indian herbs but I guess that due to weird brain-o malfunction, there is also some sweeter bourbon cask influence honey/vanilla as well as some milk chocolate notes. Quite multilayered. I had this on two nights now and even though the overall impression stays the same, there are different aspects popping up...maybe it's like the Maraba Caves and depending on in which mindset you approve it, you'll get a different experience?\\n\\n**Palate:** creamy entry, then immediately milk chocolate, spices – most dominantly salt, oaky tannin, a bit of an underlaying tart note, peat, vanilla, traces of different herbs and some sweet malt. It's a bit flat, undefined or chaotic in a way. Might be just like India in the novel? Not bad though, not really special either.\\n\\n**Finish:** chocolate, smoke, ashy, salt, nice! Not as intense as cask-strength Islay but still very nice. And quite long with drying tannin at the end. Huh, the finish was quite a nice surprise!\\n\\n**Conclusion:** I have to say I liked it a bit more on the first evening, the second go felt a bit flatter and the finish wasn't as good as the first time.

Amrut Fusion was one of those for me. I *love* Amrut Cask Strength, to the point that I'd go so far as to call it my favorite whisky that isn't made in Scotland.

I don't know that I'd have guessed that this is peated. It's very soft and has basically no smoke, iodine, or medicinal notes. Chocolate and vanilla pop up once again with spice. There's a dried grain kind of flavor to it, like the taste of malted barley that I've tried on brewery tours. \\n\\n**Finish:** More spice and dark chocolate. Dry and long. \\n\\n**Summary:** After one sip, I knew I was going to be getting a bottle. It's distinctly different from the unpeated single malt/cask strength, but similarly delicious.

       " \"**Review #6: Amrut Fusion**\\n\\nAmrut Fusion is the first Indian whisky I have tried.  It is bottled at 50% ABV, non-chillfiltered, natural color and is made using a combination of unpeated Indian barley from the foot of the Himalayas and peated Scottish barley which is then distilled and matured on site in Bangalore.  This bottle was bought at the Norwegian state liquor monopoly for a steep €90, but it can be found in other markets for much less.\\n\\n**Nose**: Thick and dense.  It's earthy, oaky and peaty which comes across as an integrated complex.  After some time I find honeyed sweetness, throat lozenges and some meaty BBQ hiding behind the initial earth/oak/peat attack.  Light ash.\\n\\n**Palate**: Nice mouthfeel.  Very balanced flavor, with rich sweet and umami notes intertwined in each other making it hard to pinpoint specific tasting notes.  Maybe some milk chocolate, maple, caramel and raisin for the sweet notes and BBQ, savory herbs, and very earthy peat for the umami?\\n\\n**Finish**: Fairly long, where the sweetness lingers longer than the savory, although it retains a certain savoriness, kind of like honey glaze or a sweet BBQ sauce.\\n\\n**Comments**:  This is an excellent and extremely well balanced whisky.  It delivers quite a suprising amount of peat – I would place it as more peaty than Highland Park but slightly less peaty than Talisker.  It is very interesting to taste a peated whisky with no briny or maritime notes whatsoever.  Instead, this one is very heavy on the earth and BBQ sauce.  It's extremely drinkable and is one of the bottles that have been going fastest in my house.

It has a tax stamp on it (neat!) and comes in a miniature canister as well.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -1.\\n\\n\\n**Nose**:  It begins peppery, hot and youthful. Very sweet, molasses, honey, aloe vera, burlap sack, oak tannins in the background. Vanilla pod, heavy cream, almost like frosting. The heat wanes and a spice melange forms with time, lily pads (like… you’d find on a lake… with frogs and such), brie, white pepper, [‘70s era Old Spice after shave]( http://i.imgur.com/YTP1rG4.jpg), peach syrup, pencil shavings, teddy bear fur, and more aloe vera.\\n\\n**Palate**:  Barley-forward. Vanilla, white pepper, butter (ghee?), raw sugar (jaggery goor?), slight hint of pear. With time it opens up into a greater mixture of spices, candle wax, the backing on lickable stamps, cotton, lemon pith, and a sort of Fisherman’s Friend taste—eucalyptus I suppose. It’s quite well balanced and put together.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Sour and citric, warming, after a while hazelnuts, French praline, cashews, green apple, pear returns—it’s halfway between cloyingly sweet and tart. Very nice. After allowing the whisky to open up for a bit the finish becomes all wax—crayons more than candles, graphite, pencil shavings and lickable stamps. It then gets b-i-t-t-e-r. Very different. I quite like it.\\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. Only downside was the screwcap wouldn’t come loose of the bit that is supposed to stay on the neck of the bottle—I nearly broke the cap trying to remove it. :/\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  At first it tasted like single malt whisky aged in an ex-bourbon cask. Not that different from anything else I’ve had, closest perhaps in character to Bruichladdich, although a bit sweeter. After a while, however, it really opened up into a bizarre combination of scents and flavours from my childhood crossed with chemicals and industrial solvents. I don’t know why, but I really dig it. Perhaps because it’s so different. It’s very easy drinking—blind I would never guess it was 46%—and I’m quite looking forward to trying the Cask Strength and Fusion miniatures that I picked up at the same time (as well as a full-sized bottle of something else in the future).\\n\\n\\n**85/100**.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Amrut Cask Strength** (*Single Malt, Indian, 5cl, 61.8% ABV, NAS, Batch No. 13, Bottled Jan 2012*)\\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $11.46 CAD\\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (woo) and comes in a miniature canister as well. Due to the ludicrously high ABV, I reviewed this at an **adjusted 46%** after adding water. Elsewise the review notes all consisted of “ow”, “ouch”, and “my god it burns”. Does this negate the point of the review? Will it be exactly the same as the normal 46% ABV Amrut offering? Read on to find out.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber -2.\\n\\n**Nose**:  Heavy-handed spices, very reminiscent of rye whisky. Cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, vanilla pod, and an underlying saccharine sweetness. With time the sweetness is identifiable as raw sugar (jaggery goor) crossed with coconut, and there are notes of toasted sesame seeds, grapeseed oil and a hint of smoke and cheese.\\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Warming, spiced, pleasant—this isn’t as hot as the basic Amrut single malt with the added water, even though they’re the same ABV. Burlap notes, rice vinegar, soybean and tapioca come to the fore. With time it opens up into white pepper, dried apricot, pears in syrup, and becomes rather barley forward just like its standard 46% cousin. Notes of toasted walnuts appear, as the spice melange continues to change—leaning more towards oak spice than rye-ish spice.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Long, oaky, slightly smoky. Very, *very* pleasant, but not very complex at first. Opens up into a nice citric note which is simultaneously sour and bitter, but in all the right ways. Ends with soya sauce, tamarind paste and the lingering bite of everlasting oak. With time in the glass the finish transforms completely, becoming very sweet and more like the lickable backs of stamps as found in the standard 46% offering’s palate, but with unsalted pistachios, soybean, toasted sesame and even more puckeringly tannic oak. \\n\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. I’m getting tired of removing tax stamps though. Not sure why I was so enamored with them before.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  Well, if you dilute it to 46% ABV it’s similar to the standard release of Amrut Single Malt Whisky—but a much, much better version of it. It’s more balanced, but that could very well be due to this being from a better batch of casks. I’d place this one head and shoulders above the standard Amrut offering, but drinking it at 61.8% is a silly idea. I might try 50-55% and add that as an addendum to this review, but without that this stands at:  \\n\\n\\n**87/100**.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion** (*Single Malt, Indian, 5cl, 50% ABV, NAS, Batch No. 22, Bottled Sept 2012*)\\n\\n\\n**Price**:  $11.46 CAD\\n\\n\\n**Tasted**:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (ugh) and comes in a miniature canister as well.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Amber +1.\\n\\n**Nose**:  Oh, my word—this is lovely stuff. If nosed immediately after pouring (or from the bottle) there’s a surge of phenols and peat smoke, but after sitting in the glass for a few minutes it recedes and distillery character takes centre stage: Dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark rum, figs, graham crackers, garam masala—cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, specifically. Amrut’s saccharine sweetness has turned treacle, as everything about this whisky is just darker than its brethren. With water it becomes a lovely gently peated dram, plenty of graham crackers, gingerbread, lovely soft pastry notes and peat. \\n\\n\\n**Palate**:  Pickling spice, peat smoke, oak, spice increases but the pickled bit recedes—a cross of oak influence and distillery character with cinnamon, white pepper, soybean and vanilla pod. It’s hot and youthful but it doesn’t go too far. It’s quite tart and has just the right amount of prickliness—especially when paired with the peat. With water it’s much less intense: citrus, barley sugar, gentle peat smoke, oak spice and tannins. Wonderfully sour.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**:  Peat smoke, oak, pickle brine, vinegar, soya sauce and a spice melange. After time it progresses into something very tannic and somewhat bitter. Eventually it turns into sweet territory with caramel and pralines surrounded by subtle drawn-out peat smoke. With water… there’s nothing remarkable. It’s weak, largely non-existent.\\n\\n**Packaging/Design**:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. The cap on this one was hard to remove, nearly broke in the process, and I really do hate tax stamps. Such a pain to remove cleanly.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion**:  This offering is quite different from standard Amrut releases, and the distillery character is subsumed by the peated spirit. I like the whisky just fine, but I can’t help but feel that peat didn’t offer any real improvement over the base offering—it’s a bluntly implemented flavour, and doesn’t blend harmoniously with Amrut’s usual characteristics. It noses amazingly, it tastes very nice, the finish is so-so on it, and it absolutely lacks balance. So slight docking of marks for those issues. Still a wonderful whisky, but could be better if it were wholly peated spirit, and not a mix of both styles. (I’m aware that exists. Perhaps I’ll have to try it.)  \\n\\n\\n**83/100**.',\n",

       " '**Amrut Fusion**\\n\\n**Region:** India\\n\\n**ABV:** 50%\\n\\n**Cask:** Oak Barrels\\n\\n**Color-Added?** Possibly. Bottle and website make no mention of “natural color”.\\n\\n**Chill-Filtered?** No. Bottle states that this is Non-Chill Filtered.\\n\\nI had made a note to try Amrut, India’s first whisky distillery, thanks to various reviews here on r/worldwhisky and a few whisky review sites. The reviews were generally favorable, and it piqued my interest. I had never heard of Indian whisky before, but doing some research it seems Jim Murray named Amrut Fusion as his Third Finest Whisky in the World in his Whisky Bible 2010. Amrut Distilleries started in 1948 and they were looking into making rum and brandy early on, before finally launching single malt whiskies in 2004.\\n\\nIt seems that similar to Kavalan (from Taiwan), Amrut’s casks also suffer from the extreme heat as their “angel’s share” (the amount lost to evaporation) each year was in the 11 – 12% range(!), compared to Scotland, where the angel’s share is closer to 2%. So it’s understandable that Amrut wouldn’t really have very old age statement whiskies. I was excited to finally be able to try an Amrut bottle, thanks to my local whisky bar.\\n\\nAmrut Fusion is a combination of Indian and peated Scottish barley, hence the name.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Color & Appearance:** [0.7](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg), Amber. A swirl around the glass revealed thin, fast falling legs.\\n\\n**Nose:** Light antiseptic, Band-Aids, dusty dunnage, fallen leaves, sour beer, cider, apples.\\n\\n**Palate:** Thin, watery mouthfeel. Lightly peated, a distant beach bonfire, coastal salinity, there’s a delicious quality that reminds me of a Bunnahabhain 12 Year, maybe even the 18 Year, but watered down. Vanilla, caramel sweetness, ginger heat.\\n\\n**Finish:** Medium finish. Sea spray, more of those coastal notes on the finish. Spicy ginger, lingering vanilla, caramel.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised by my first encounter with Indian whisky in the form of Amrut Fusion. It’s got a lot of interesting notes from the start: The nose with antiseptic qualities reminded me a bit of Springbank (but less intense). The palate had qualities that evoked a young Bunnahabhain, but thinner.\\n\\nOverall a pleasant dram, but undermined by its thin, watery mouthfeel. You could see it in the legs on the glass, and it continued to the palate. Still, I wouldn’t mind getting a dram at a bar to mix things up from time-to-time, and I’d love to see what a thicker, more viscous Amrut would be like.\\n\\n**Rating:** 70 / 100\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Rating System:** (Inspired by hs305 (with permission))\\n\\n10 - a dram I would not serve even to my fiercest enemy\\n\\n20 - a dram for guests that are overdue to leave\\n\\n30 - a dram that is drinkable but why should I when there is a spittoon\\n\\n40 - a dram that I can drink, but I donate the leftover of the bottle to a party\\n\\n50 - a dram I drink seldomly and only when I am in the mood for exploration\\n\\n60 - a dram that I can drink until the bottle is finished, but I do not buy a second bottle\\n\\n70 - a dram I regularly enjoy and that I serve to my friends without any doubts\\n\\n80 - a dram I recommend to my friends, and would buy another bottle\\n\\n90 - a dram I share with my best friends only, and would buy every bottle at a reasonable price\\n\\n95 - a dram for special occasions only: I am tempted to buy a bottle even at unreasonable prices\\n\\n100 - perfection\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n/u/review_bot latest',\n",

       " 'AMRUT ~~VERTICAL~~ HORIZONTAL (thanks, Loweeel)\\n\\nAmrut was my first world whisky.  I tried the Fusion in a bar several years ago, specifically because I’d never had an Indian whisky before and I wanted to give it a shot – and boy am I glad I did!  I had a bunch of minis and samples around, so one night I decided to treat myself and do a nice, side-by-side review of some of their offerings.\\n\\n**Single Malt Cask Strength** (Batch #18, 61.8%)\\n\\nSome people get watches when they graduate college.  When I graduated in December, my reward to myself was a trip to The Party Source in Cincinnati.  It is a pilgrimage that all whisky nerds in the region should make!  I picked up a number of awesome whiskies, plus two Amrut minis – this one, and the Amrut peated which is reviewed below.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tangy honey and tropical fruit.  A tad oily.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Honey, vanilla and malt in a big way!  Honey lingers in the finish.  There is a distinct savory-ness to it, almost like a white whisky but not funky.  This is NOT a light whisky – heavy and oily.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Oily malt and vanilla take over.  More akin to a highland scotch now.  Molasses.  I also got a hint of Luxardo, which is quite interesting!\\n\\n*Taste:*  Malt and vanilla and some oiliness.  Wonderful balance of flavors.  Not too sweet, but certainly sweet.\\n\\n87/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  This is a delicious and complex whisky, and a great option if you want a neat variation on the bourbon-matured, highland scotch style.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Fusion** (50%)\\n\\nAs I said in the intro, this was my first world whisky, and to date it is the only Amrut I have bought a full bottle of.  I do want to note, though, that this bottle was open for close to a year and a half by the time I got around to reviewing it.  I transferred it to smaller bottles several times to prevent oxidation, but some was inevitable.  I imagine if I had a new bottle, the peat would stand out a bit more.  At any rate…\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tropical fruit.  Light peat smoke. Molasses.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Sweet and savory malt with light smokiness.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Molasses!  Soft vanilla malt.\\n\\n*Taste:*  A slightly savory – but NOT oily – malt.\\n\\n85/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  Really interesting stuff here.  I am still kicking myself that I didn’t pick up a few more when the PLCB put this on closeout last year.  $46 a bottle.  What could have been…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Peated** (Batch #10, 46%)\\n\\nOnce again, I picked this up at The Party Source in December.  Nothing else to see here.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Surprisingly light peat.  Tangy fruit.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Oily phenols and burnt rubber (in a good way) fade into lovely fruity malt.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Smoke subsides, but fruit and spice linger.  Cinnamon and molasses.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Peat is assertive, but sweet.  Lingers much longer into the finish.  Tangy fruit.\\n\\n83/100\\n\\n(*) - Try it.  Good quality, interesting, but not mind blowing.  It’s not going to replace the Ardbeg or Laphroaig on your shelf, but it is worth investigating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Blackadder Peated Rawcask** (62.7%, bottled 6/12)\\n\\nThis one has a story.  My final project for my chemistry major was an analysis of phenols in peated whisky, and it just so happens that a man who imports a number of spirit brands into the US (among them, Amrut and Blackadder) lives in my home town.  I got in touch with him to see if I could get some samples for the project, and he donated a number of whiskies.  The prize among them was this – an independently bottled, cask strength, unfiltered, peated Amrut.  I wan’t even aware that IB Amruts existed before I had the sample in my hands.\\n\\n*Nose:*  Sweet orange.  Earthy peat.  Difficult to get past the alcohol.\\n\\n*Taste:*  ALCOHOL.  Big peat.  Orange, again; I’ve tasted a similar note in Smith & Cross rum.\\n\\n*with water and time…*\\n\\n*Nose:*  Citrus fruit.  Beautiful peated malt; sweet and fruity.  Amazing.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Boy howdy… luscious, fruity, peated malt.  Fruity without the sweetness you get from certain Islay whiskies – Laphroaig and Ardbeg come to mind.\\n\\n\\nNow, with that, I could have said OK, done for the day – but I had a feeling I could get more out of this one.  So, a few days later, I poured another glass, watered it to about 50%, covered it and let it sit for a good long time (I can’t recall how long exactly, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was an hour or two).  The result:\\n\\n*Nose:*  Tropical fruits.  Faint, faint peat smoke.  There’s a oiliness that is competeing with the overall sweetness of it.\\n\\n*Taste:*  Oh boy.  Peat. Peat peat peat.  A brief initial sweetness with tangy malt and fruit.  Reminds me of an Ardbeg, but with a more reserved sweetness.  This can go head to head with Islay any day of the week.  Saline and oily, in a good way – like a rich dessert.  Heavy.  You really can’t rush this one… it demands you drink it slowly.\\n\\n90/100\\n\\n(**) - Buy it.  Good luck finding this one in the wild, but if you see it, buy it.  Do not hesitate.  At the same time though, I wouldn’t necessarily go out of my way to hunt one down as some would with a limited release bourbon.  Blackadder bottles a damn good whisky, and while this was excellent – by far the best Amrut I’ve had – this was NOT the best Blackadder I’ve had.  All in all I am incredibly thankful I got to try this one; this is a unicorn whisky if there ever was one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion:  Amrut is a damn good distillery.  From these notes, I’d say that the defining character of an Amrut whisky is tropical fruit notes and a decided oily, heavy body.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\nEDIT: Formatting',\n",
       " \"Hello scotchit! Today i'm reviewing Amrut Fusion, from a sample sent to me by /u/Sparktrader. This is my 2nd world whisky, and 1st Indian single malt.

Slainte!\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion**  \\n*50% ABV, NCF, 50 ml sample*\\n\\n* **Appearance** Gold.\\t\\n\\n* **Nose** Malty malt, licorice, citrus, orange marmalade, peat, oak.   \\n Big on the citrus and malt. The peat blends in quite nicely.\\n\\n* **Palate** Sugary sweet, nectarine, orange candy, citrus, malt, faint peat.  \\n Again, citrus and malt dominates, and the peat is very faint. \\n\\n* **Finish** Drying, peat, citrus, orange zest.  \\nThe peat returns in a very nice and dry finish. \\n\\nSo this is what Amrut is all about? It's certainly pretty good. But i hope Amrut can do better with their other expressions. \\n\\n**77/100**\\n\\n**Buy again? No.**\",\n",
       " 'I’m a bit late with this one. Amrut made a big noise a few years ago when it won some awards and got recognised as a solid malt, and in this case rightfully so. Amrut hails from India, but is actually produced almost entirely for export. They began making local spirits (most locally made ‘whisky’ in India is actually made from molasses) in 1948 and eventually began making more premium spirits including a single malt whisky in the early 2000’s and then decided to take on the global whisky market.\\n\\n\\nThis expression is one of their more popular ones, named fusion because it is distilled from a mix of 75% locally grown unpeated barley and 25% peated barley from Scotland. No age statement here, but generally their whiskies are quite young due to quick maturation in the hot Indian climate.\\n\\n**No age statement. 50%ABV.** \\n\\n* **Nose:** Dirty grains. Leather. Pepper. Peaches. Oranges with cinnamon. Bit of an earthy note.Dry grass. Something gentle and floral lurking in the back. A vanilla toffee note shows up with some glass time.\\n\\n* **Palate:** Thick mouthfeel. Quite a rich grainy note. Then some dry cardboard which hints at an earthy peat (similar to highland peat not Islay). Toffee. Oranges. Mocha.\\n\\n* **Finish:** Long. Quite spicy here. Cinnamon, cardamom and pepper. Dry wood. Some hints of woodsmoke. Oiled leather.\\n\\n**Would I buy this:** No (I just got one for curiosity’s sake, probably won’t get another)\\n\\n**Would I order this in a bar:** Yes\\n\\n**Would I drink this if someone gave me a glass:** Yes\\n\\n**VFM:** 3/5\\n\\nThis was an interesting one. It had a lot of notes I liked but I felt like there wasn’t enough emphasis on those, maybe just a little unbalanced. Still a well made whisky, very much on a par with what Scotland has to offer. I’ll be looking forward to trying many more Amrut expressions.\\n\\nReviewed in my blog:\\nhttps://iwriteaboutstuffilike.com/2016/05/28/amrut-fusion/',\n",
       " \"**Amrut Single Malt**\\n\\n**46% ABV**\\n\\n* **Nose:** The nose has lemongrass and hay accompanied by sweet pears and vanilla as well as a decent jolt of bourbon like sweetness and licorice spice.  A nose that seems very fresh and inviting.\\n\\n* **Taste:** A nice bit of heat in the arrival, perhaps an indication of this whisky's younger age.  The heat is not overpowering.  The taste then sweetens substantially to a savory mix of vanilla and mild cola.  Barley and fresh cut hay notes round out the experience.\\n\\n* **Finish:** The finish holds some heat as well, but again it works in this whisky.  The finish is a somewhat bitter-sweet affair, with vanilla and pear, but then a drier oakiness takes you through until the end.\\n\\nA good example of when a younger whisky, and all its usual attributes, work well together.  The humid maturation conditions make for a young whisky that behaves well at a young age.  Good cask selection seems to be in effect as well.\\n\\n**88/100**\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion**\\n\\n**50% ABV**\\n\\n* **Nose:** A nose of sweet smoke, chocolate and almonds.  Slightly salty and briny.  There's a fresh oakiness as well.  Mild barley notes waft through on a bed of green apple and cinnamon.  Quite a nice nose.\\n\\n* **Taste:** A steady sweet arrival.  The smoke dies but the sweetness lives on.  Fresh and dried fruits , particularly savory dates. Some vanilla and licorice as well.  The barley notes are still there but are overshadowed by all the others.\\n\\n* **Finish:** The finish is leans more towards a drier experience, with a slight return of the smoke, with treacle and the spices becoming more dominate. The fresh fruit is there, just not as pronounced.\\n\\nA top notch whisky, a good balance of sweet and smoky.  The nose and taste are of high quality as well... very good.\\n\\n**90/100**\\n\\nBoth whiskey's are of high quality and provide a nice whisky experience.  I would most definitely purchase both again, particularly the standard Single Malt.  To me it provides very good value and a great example of a young NAS whisky done right.  While the Fusion does cost more, I still consider it a decent value, and there is no denying its high quality.\",\n",

Growing sweetness as the sherry pulls ahead. \\n\\n* **Taste:**The sherry comes out in front here again. It’s similar to a young Speyside like Singleton or ‘Farclas 12. Nice subtle fruity flavours with a bit of spice. All the while that smoke and peat is still there coming in waves but I’m not quite sure if it’s complimenting or fighting against the sherry. After a while in the glass the smoke becomes stronger and I also get a bit of a caramel touch with the spice intensifying. After a little while in the glass this whiskey works itself out nicely. \\n\\n* **Finish:**The sherry accepts its defeat here and the peat finally comes through as a peaty smokiness building almost to an Islay level. Bit of a light burn. \\n\\n\\n* **Thoughts:** The Amrut website they say that there are no sherry casks used in the creation of this whiskey despite its sherry notes which they confirm in their own review.

Does this whisky taste like the ultimate fusion of East and West?? … I honestly don’t know. But it’s tasty.\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion.** Indian single malt. 50% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.\\n\\n**Price Paid:** $78 CAD for 700 mL in Ontario. \\n\\n**Mashbill:** 75% unpeated barley from India, 25% peated barley from Scotland.\\n\\n**Barrels:** Aged at the Amrut distillery in Bangalore, India in a combination of new and ex-bourbon American Oak barrels.\\n\\n**Served:** Neat, in a large copita. Sampled at my local liquor monopoly’s tasting bar. Rested 5 or so minutes.\\n\\n**Colour:** Medium gold.\\n\\n**Nose:**My first thought was Earl Grey tea! That’s a new one. Floral, with clove and distinct cardamom. I got hit with the peated notes next: earthy, almost muddy, slightly funky and meaty, and mild smoke. Almost reminiscent of Springbank. There’s plenty of fruit too, like apples, cooked peaches, pineapple, banana, and some blood orange. Vanilla and roasted marshmallow. A nice, earthy malt flavour is in there, too.\\n\\nA drop of water lightened up the nose and brought out a maple syrup note. \\n\\n**Palate:** Thick and warming feel. I found the peat! It’s more up front here than in the nose. Dry, smoked meat, earthy, and slightly medicinal. The roasted marshmallow from the nose has caught fire now, as all roasted marshmallows inevitably do. Ginger spice. More of that nice malt flavour.\\n\\n**Finish:** Ashy and slightly briny, but it stays pretty sweet. Some of the fruit lingers, and I began to pick up red grape in here of all things. Some oak, earth, and an almost nutty character. I was still tasting it 20 minutes after my last sip.\\n\\n**Notes:** Indian whisky has come out swinging. This is really good, and was giving that [20 year old Arran]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/8blcmr/review_50_arran_20_year_single_cask/) that I was tasting it next to a run for its money. For me, the flavour profile fits right in with other mildly peated scotch whiskies, like Highland Park 12, Springbank 10, Benromach 10, and Bowmore 15. It’s got more of a floral and tropical fruit character than any of those though, without losing that weighty, peated character. To top it off, the value for money here is pretty fantastic. As soon as I get through my bottle of Benromach, I’m picking up one of these.\\n\\n**Final score: 86/100**\\n\\n**Rating Scale:**\\n\\n0-49: Blech.\\n\\n50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.\\n\\n60-69: Below average. I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.\\n\\n70-74: Sorta average. You can do better.\\n\\n75-79: Above average.

       " 'Who is pacifen? Awesome sauce, that\\'s who. And the person who sent me a great sample of the next dram I\\'ll be reviewing, **Amrut Fusion.**\\n\\nLast week I reviewed the [Amrut Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1fuxdh/amrut_cask_strength_review/), granted a day late. I\\'ve been cutting back on drinking the past while, and exercising/working has taken up a lot of my time, so when I finally won myself a free weekend, I decided it was time to catch up on some of the amazing samples I received from swaps while catching up on Game of Thrones (finally). Haven\\'t seen the 10th episode yet, so let\\'s keep this thread spoiler free.\\n\\nWhen I first read about **Amrut Fusion**, I assumed it would be a fancy way of saying \"double barreled\". And you know what happens when you assume? You\\'re a jack ass and you\\'re wrong, that\\'s what.\\n\\nAnd let me tell you, I was super wrong. It\\'s actually a fusion of barley grown in Scotland and India. So I was a little confused during my review, as I was expecting more currants, dates, strawberries, and fruits. Then I decided to not try to review with guessing what I was reviewing, and looked some things up to make sure I wasn\\'t going insane.\\n\\nJury\\'s still out on my sanity, so let\\'s move along to my review.\\n\\n**Region:** India\\n\\n**Abv:** 50%\\n\\n**Price:** $68.95 (CAD)\\n\\n**Colour:** Light pus\\n\\n**Nose:** Strawberries, sticky toffee, lemon curd, basil, peat, musk, white cake, dark cherry syrup, vanilla\\n\\nVery nice nose on this one. Somewhat sweet, somewhat peaty, somewhat musky, has a little bit of everything. Almost going in 5 directions at once, which worries me a little bit, as typically that means it won\\'t work that well. Takes awhile to open up, which is odd for something at 50% Abv.\\n\\n**Taste:** Lemon juice, jalapeno, pepper, peat, cumin, cucumber, apple, sour cherry, licorice, oak, almond, strawberry\\n\\nHmmm... It\\'s quite hot and sweet now, almost like a Highland. And if you\\'ve been following me, you\\'ll know that I\\'m not the biggest fan of that Highland flavour. On the other hand, it\\'s not weak, there\\'s some peat, and the fruit/oak mixture pairs well. Jury\\'s still out on this one.\\n\\nWow, that Jury is busy.\\n\\nI\\'m missing some of the overwhelming flavours from the Cask Strength I think. Which is silly, as this is 50%, which is amazing, and I\\'m being silly and I need to get over it. I need to come down to earth after some of these drams, I\\'m being spoiled.\\n\\n**Finish:** Lime rind, peat, hazelnut, dry, soil, parsley, cocoa, chili powder, dry, soil, parlsley, leather\\n\\nMedium length on the finish, nice calming flavours that fade away leaving a dryness and an odd hybrid of Highland/Islay flavours. I think the finish is the best part of this one.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** It\\'s never easy reviewing a whisky after you\\'ve had a similar one from the same distillery with a higher Abv. And it\\'s not really fair to compare them, however that\\'s why we have numbers and that\\'s why we review.\\n\\n**Amrut Fusion** is good, and I would buy a bottle, even at the LCBO prices. That being said, there are some misses here. When you read that it\\'s a mixture of barley from different places, it does suffer from a somewhat disjoint flavour profile. It does a lot of things, and while some of those things match up, it\\'s all over the place. I\\'m very glad that they didn\\'t finish this one with a wine cask of some sort, as that would have overworked my tongue more.\\n\\nAnd as we\\'ve learned from Michael Douglas this past week, an overworked tongue can be deadly.\\n\\n**83/100**\\n\\n*Review #18, Indian Whisky #3*',\n",

I'm approaching 100 reviews on the whiskey network and this is just my third world review....In my defense the stores around me have a very small selection of Canadian and Irish essentially boiling down to CC and regular Jameson. I've got my eyes peeled for more and I'm definitely willing to expand my horizons beyond bourbon and scotch! Either way, I've been sitting on this bottle of Amrut for a very long time.

All in all it's unique and inviting! **9/10**\\n\\n**Taste** oaky-vanilla custard, soft earthy peat, coffee, chocolate, almost a vague sherry note as well. Very unique, very complex, very tasty! **45/50**\\n\\n**Body** a medium-thick body that leaves behind too much oiliness in the mouth. It allows flavors to hang around longer, but it also leaves and off-putting trail. **6/10**\\n\\n**Finish** The finish has a medium-short length with minimal heat. Somewhat uneventful. The flavors hang around though and a nice dried apricot note emerges. **16/20**\\n\\n**Value** At $60 a bottle I'm counting on the juice inside to be great, and Amrut fusion lives up to that. It's a really interesting whisky that gives a nice break from a typical Single Malt and keeps me wanting to come back for more. **9/10**\\n***\\n**Overall** This fusion of eastern (Indian) and western (Scottish) barley ends up being a very interesting and very enjoyable dram.

Never would guess this is 46%, nice flavors. \\n\\n**Finish:** Spice,oak. bitter, dry, medium to long, barley, dried grass and tobacco. Some fruit notes in the background.\\n\\n\\n**Score: 87-88ish**\\n\\n\\n**Overall:** Would have loved this at higher proof. I can see why Amrut uses so many wine casks to impart other flavors. This was much more subtle, though still really good. Curious to see how this evolves with time and air. Incredibly easy to drink, but hard to pin everything down in it. Lot less oak than I was expecting, I was fearing an oak bomb from the specs. \\n\\n\\nIt is not the bold blast of flavors I am used to from the younger single casks with powerful wine finishes or maturations.  This is Amrut calmed down and a little more restrained. But sure this is where Amrut excels. But considering the angels share lost in these casks, I do not think we will see many older Amrut releases. \\n\\n\\nAlso nice to see the next version of Greedy Angels is now 60% for the new 12 year release. \\n',\n",

For anyone who does not know, I am a massive fan of Amrut and likely the most prolific reviewer of it on /r/worldwhisky.  The fact I get to try a new Amrut, let alone one of the releases I would consider a “unicorn” makes this a very special pour. \\n\\nFor those that do not know the story behind this whisky, when Amrut Greedy Angels 10 Year was released, it was bottled at 46% ABV, but they also included a 50ml bottle of the uncut whisky at cask strength (71%). \\n\\n**Nose:** Earthy, nutty, curry, pineapple, oak, ginger, clove.  Some of the other guys who got to nose with said it smelled of Indian food, which considering the strong curry notes I can believe. So much more powerful compared to the 46% version. \\n\\n**Palate:** Bold to put it lightly. Earthy, oak, pineapple, malt, diesel, ginger, cardamom, cumin. Massive amount of flavor, tons of spice, oak, tannins and tropical fruit.  I can see why water was added for the primary bottling. This is crazy. \\n\\n\\n**Finish:** Massive and long. Tannins, clove, oak, earthy, black tea, sesame, honey, cardamom, diesel. This is funky, industrial and aggressive. The finish lingers forever.  From an objective point of view, this is too tannic and industrial, but really cool to experience Amrut at this age and ABV. \\n\\n\\n**Score: 90 for the amazing experience of it, as I love Amrut.  88 in terms of actual taste/profile.** \\n\\n\\nSo, it really did make sense to water down the whisky for this release.

Lots of complexity here. Reminds me of Glenmorangie 18 a bit. \\n\\n**Palate:** Tons going on here. Up front it's tons of maltiness and dry oak, bright tropical fruit, heathery floral notes again with some earthy minerality and incredibly light smoke. Lots of spice and pepper in the mid palate and a slight brine.

       " 'Thanks to /u/xile_ for sharing a dram of this one with us.\\n\\nHad a whisky tasting. And for this one, we went all out.\\n\\nUp first... You know what? I\\'m going to assume you want to know more about the whisky than anything else. And for this one, I\\'m going to be succinct.\\n\\nWe drank a lot of whiskies. And I felt okay enough to review 8 out of 9.\\n\\nUp first was **Amrut 10 Greedy Angels**, which means we weren\\'t fucking around at all. I had to sit up straight, have everything ready to go, and then realize I was facing the light when I took pictures and therefore don\\'t have a picture of it in the glass.\\n\\nBut there were witnesses this time so I\\'m not too worried.\\n\\nYou may be asking yourself \"Why is a 10 year old Whisky so special?\" Well I\\'ll tell you:\\n\\nIn India, it\\'s very hot and humid. So much so that whisky evaporates quicker than other places, and as such, leaving anything in the cask for a long, long time means more and more of your profits go into the waiting, greedy mouths of Angels.\\n\\nLoss in Scotland, for instance, is 1-2% during maturation. In India it\\'s 10-12%. Thus there were only 320 bottles sold, each with a miniature of cask strength 71%. We didn\\'t drink that. That\\'s for /u/xile_ to drink.\\n\\nThus most of Amrut\\'s releases are 3-5 years old. This is the second oldest Indian whisky, and oldest at the time of release.\\n\\nThat\\'s pretty special. This one ended up having some controversy due to the Alcohol content. Some people mentioned they could have kept it higher and only reduced the amount of whisky available by 1/3. But Amrut didn\\'t, and that\\'s their thing. Live and learn.\\n\\nLet\\'s see how it tastes, shall we?\\n\\n**Price:** Never made it to the LCBO\\n\\n**Region:** India\\n\\n**Abv:** 46%\\n\\n**Colour:** 5Y 8/8\\n\\n**Nose:** Butter, wheat, ginger, spiced apples, pineapple, barley\\n\\nVery light on the nose. Given time, the standard Amrut profile starts to really shine. Wheat/Tropical Fruit/Spice.\\n\\nThings meld here a lot better than the younger ones. It\\'s more of everything working as a team, rather than flavours jumping in. Like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the end of each of the movies, versus at the start.\\n\\nMaybe the spice apples are Raph? I\\'m thinking too far into this. Moving on...\\n\\n**Taste:** Caramel, dry Champagne, butterscotch, grainy, lemon\\n\\nThis reminds me exactly of a really good Champagne. Except no bubbles. I guess I could have added Sprite, but... that seems silly.\\n\\nLess spice than I was expecting. More yeast, dry elements, pears. I know putting \"Champagne\" is a cop out, and wanted to describe it more, however the more I drank, the more that note sprung out.\\n\\nLike the Foot Clan.\\n\\nMoving on....\\n\\n**Finish:** Apple, oak, toast/rye, sesame, meat, smoke, pineapple\\n\\nLong. Super long finish. Probably one of the best finishes I\\'ve had in a long time. And all at a low Abv.\\n\\nBig bread notes, continuing on the really nice yeast flavours. Like it was made in Donnie\\'s lab even.\\n\\nIgnoring that, it has a really interesting, almost Hawaiian pizza flavour at the end, with all the meat and pineapple. A true \"Cowabunga Dude\" moment, if you will.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** All in all, very tasty, and shows a really amazing growth. Something this well made at a low alcohol content takes a lot of work. It\\'s older, and not complex in ways that older drams are. It\\'s a new animal, if you will. Some sort of creature from the ooze.\\n\\nThis is not complex in the way a 21+ year old Scotch is. It\\'s complex in the way a well blended Scotch is. Or it\\'s hard to explain. Lots of flavours that meld well together and are tasty.\\n\\nDrink this if you have the chance. It\\'s a game changer.\\n\\n**85/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky review #185, India review #23, Whisky Network review #872*\\n\\n*Other Amrut reviews:*\\n\\n* [Amrut Bangalore Tiger Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1fuxdh/amrut_cask_strength_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Ex-Bourbon Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Fusion](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1g1jb1/amrut_fusion_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Indian Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Kadhambam No. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Naarangi](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Blackadder Raw Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Cask Strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1mrvhb/amrut_peated_cask_strengthreview/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Port Pipe Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Peated Single Malt](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Portonova](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut PX Single Cask](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n* [Amrut Two Continents (2nd Release)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5gllt8/amrutpocalayplse_12_part_review/)\\n \\n\\n[Link to my website with all my reviews](http://tomoderawhisky.wordpress.com)',\n",

Given the high temperatures and humidity in India the loss of whisky during maturation is close to 10-12% per year in comparison to Scotland’s 1-2%, making the aging of these malts a tricky affair and the quantity left for bottling quite meagre compared to what was started off with.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Nose:** Spiced apples, orange zest, hay, pineapple, caramel, hint of oak\\n\\n**Taste:** Malt, pineapple, apricots, dried grass, shortbread, mint, white pepper\\n\\n**Finish:** Sesame seeds, oak, apple, orange peel, hint of banana\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe nose is fruity, with background notes of spices and to a lesser extent hay/oak. Beyond the strong singular notes up front, it seems to have a bit more depth beneath the surface but the flavours are tightly packed together making it hard to pick apart. The texture is oily, again with sweet fruity notes leading the charge, turning grassy with a peppery kick on the tail end. Some citrus bitterness and sesame add an extra dimension to the finish. Leaves a gentle warmth behind.\\n\\nEasy drinking, fairly straightforward… there’s not as much complexity as one might expect.

The peat adds an extra dimension to the flavour profile, with a mild earthiness that adds depth (alternating as a foreground note and supporting cast in the background).

       " '**Whisky Network Review #42**\\n\\n\\nAmrut Distilleries is the major Indian single malt whisky-maker.  A number of their whiskies are popular here, but I haven\\'t seen a lot about this particular expression.  \\n\\n\\nFor Amrut Intermediate Sherry, the distilled spirit starts off in a mix of ex-bourbon and virgin oak casks. It then gets transferred into sherry casks before going back into bourbon casks to complete its final maturation (hence the \"intermediate sherry\" name). Note that while there is not a lot of information about this distinctive process online, the product label inside my box specifically states that the whisky is transferred into \"Spanish ex-Oloroso sherry butts\" for one year. I will come back to this point at the end.\\n\\n\\nI picked up my full bottle in my travels. Amrut Intermediate Sherry is bottled at cask-strength, 57.1% ABV in this case. It is obviously not chill-filtered, and I believe no artificial colouring is used.\\n\\n\\n**Colour**:  Rich golden/orangey brown. You can see the effect of ex-bourbon and sherry cask aging.\\n\\n\\n**Nose**: Rich nose, bringing in both moist earth and dried tobacco. Very sweet, with heavy raisin and grape overtones, along with blueberries and tropical fruits like banana and kiwis. Chocolate fudge and vanilla cake. This is not your typical Oloroso sherry-finished single malt. Surprisingly, not much ethanol singe despite the high ABV.\\n\\n\\n**Palate**: The berry notes from the nose are accentuated, with blackberry and red currants joining the strong blueberry presence. I get a definite impression of blueberry-banana pancakes with maple syrup! Surprising kick of rye spices, particularly cinnamon and all-spice, plus a bit of anise (black licorice) and pepper. Very spicy overall - I\\'m guessing most of this must be coming from the oak casks. Creamy mouthfeel, but with a drying effect over time. This moist earth/syrupy/astringent combo reminds me of some of the Kavalan fortified wine-finished casks. Water brings up the sweeter port-like grape flavours.\\n\\n\\n**Finish**: Medium long. Sweet wood notes, like hickory (but not as smokey). Lingering fruit, like left-over blueberry pie crust. There is a drying astringency, and a bit of bitterness creeps in over time (but it is not excessive, and water helps here too). A touch of that classic nutty rancio aroma from fortified wines shines through.\\n\\n\\nThe blueberry experience is really wild here - I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever come across this much of it before. But this is definitely not your typical dry Oloroso sherry-finished expression.  Indeed, I\\'d say it tastes more like a mix of various fortified wines - including both sherry and port - went into finishing this one (along with the ex-bourbon casks).\\n\\n\\nDoing more digging, it seems like they may have actually used a mix of sherry and port casks for the intermediate step. See my full commentary for [this whisky](http://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/2016/10/06/amrut-intermediate-sherry/) on my whiskyanalysis.com website for more info and links.\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I slightly prefer the Intermediate Sherry over the Amrut Portonova (which I plan to review soon).

This makes me want to search out a sample of their CS Peated even more, not to mention their true unicorns. That said, I do think the price might be a little high. It doesn’t bother me enough to mark it as such in the review, but $100 is steep for a straight-forward, sherried single malt when you have Aberlours and Glendronachs all the way along the $50-$100 spectrum. Either way – if you like sherried whiskeys, especially ones without too much sulfur on them, get this guy. \\n',\n",
       " 'Amrut is an Indian line of single malt whisky - the name, according to the company, translates to “elixir of life”.

Thanks to /u/tintin777 for the sample.\\n\\n**Nose** - Tart red berries with a backbone of oaky spices - black pepper especially, but what’s interesting (to me, at least) is I’m getting a good bit of fennel, and maybe some celery seed here too. There’s a charred wood element in the background as well, and hints of gingersnap cookies. Somewhat medicinal too, there’s something there that reminds me a bit of cherry Nyquil. Rather intense. Bourbon-y honey and vanilla notes come and go.\\n\\n**Taste** - Red berries, charred wood, with some big spices - black pepper, red pepper flakes, and a kind of drying spice I can’t quite put my finger on - the fennel note again, maybe - coming in as it develops. Gingerbread makes an appearance as well. Some big spice notes are at work here, but other flavors seem somewhat undeveloped/muted. Like the nose, sometimes I get some bourbon cask honey and vanilla notes, at times I don’t. Overall fairly tasty. Very rich, thick body.\\n\\n**Finish** - I get a little vanilla and honey here, with ginger, lots of black pepper, and a little allspice. The tart berry note amplifies a bit here before fading and giving way to the spices. The bourbon cask notes make themselves known most here. Spices linger a while.\\n\\nWell this one was tasty, but, not particularly memorable. There are some nice individual elements here, but part of me thinks this is a whisky that doesn’t really know what it wants to be when it grows up...maybe all these different types of casks are a bit much. Still a pleasant dram, but I can’t see myself spending $100+ for it.\\n\\n**86**/100',\n",

They have such a unique base character to their spirit; creamy and wonderfully malty. I was hoping this one would be a bit heavier on the sherry, but as it is, the sherry takes a back seat to a fairly standard Amrut whisky.

       " 'The Indian spirits company, Amrut Distilleries, founded in 1948, is known domestically as a producer of popular rum, brandy, vodka, gin, & blended whisky brands. India, historically, has not had a culture of drinking malt whiskies- in fact, many of their domestic whiskies, until recently, were made with a blend of grain & sugarcane molasses. In 2004, Amrut launched their first single malt whisky label, intended exclusively for the UK market. They followed up with a domestic release in 2010. Suffice to say, the response exceeded expectations. The peak of their fame came in 2010 when Jim Murray named Amrut Fusion the 3rd best whisky in the world. Like Japan before them, Indian single malts have now been garnering a great deal of attention and a number of accolades on the world stage.\\n\\nThis expression represents interesting innovation in the world of cask-finished whiskies. The Intermediate Sherry, as its name implies, is aged in a mix of new American oak & ex-bourbon casks, then transferred into a range of wine casks (oloroso sherry & port, among them) before going back into ex-bourbon casks.

I like this.\\n* **Mouthfeel:** Medium body, but with quite a bit of punch!\\n* **Palate:** Spice! Sweet fruit juice, a blend of blueberry-apple-plum-strawberry. Toasted & charred oak. Brûléed sugars.\\n* **Finish:** A long & rich finish. Rich waves of spice subside into more dried figs, fig newton cookies, spice cake with raisins, a bit more of that barbecue sauce, with some heavily toasted oak & wafting wood char. Slight bitter oak note present. Not overly sweet on the finish.\\n\\n**Overall:** I really feel like I just had some barbecued chicken, marinated in a sweet & savory barbecue sauce, and charred on the grill. Somewhat like a Mezcal de Pechuga without the heady smoke aspect. Figs in marsala sauce. Wonderfully rich with dark dried fruit, plenty of toasted oak, and savory umami notes. But still not overly sweet, which is a nice change of pace for a heavily sherried whisky. It actually grew a bit sweeter on the finish as I continued to sip on this dram.

Let's have a taste.\\n\\n*Amrut Intermediate Sherry, 57.1% ABV, no color added, no chill filtration*\\n\\n* **Color:** Deep amber with red-orange tint.\\n* **Nose:** Very rich.  Pumpkin bread, strawberry shortcake and blackberry jam.  Lots of cooked dark fruits.  Nice influence from the sherry.  Cinnamon and cloves pop up after the first taste.  French toast shows with some water.\\n* **Palate:** Tastes a lot like it smells.  Like a piece of toast covered in strawberry jam.  Strawberries and dark cherries prominent.  Plum also.  Oatmeal raisin cookies.\\n* **Finish:** LONG.  Lots of baking spice.  Very warm finish.  Strawberry jam again.  Sticks with the tongue for a while.\\n\\nA great dram.  Reminds me of a big breakfast with the french toast and strawberry jam notes.  The sherry definitely had its way with this whisky and I love it.  Still retains that Amrut character though.  Not hot at all for 57%.\\n\\n**89/100**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Amrut Portonova, 62.1% ABV, no color added, no chill filtration*\\n\\n* **Color:** Pinkish orange.\\n* **Nose:** Prunes, red licorice, raisins, maple.  Nose is a bit lighter than expected for the proof.  Milk chocolate and apricot jam show with time.  Sugar plums and stronger maple with water.\\n* **Palate:** Bubble gum flavored toothpaste was my first thought.  Honey and graham crackers.  Very syrupy in the mouth.  Brown sugar, raisins, and baking spice let you know you're drinking Amrut.  Grape candy shows with water.\\n* **Finish:** Some significant alcohol burn, even after adding water.  Watermelon.  Bitter cabernet drying effect.  Some cinnamon and rye bread.\\n\\nABV is much more noticeable on this than the Intermediate Sherry, though to be fair it is also 5% higher alcohol content.  This one definitely needs a little water.  I'd say this one is more complex than the Intermediate Sherry, but overall didn't hit quite as many high notes for me as that one did.  Still a great whisky, and I might try it with water from the start next time I drink it.  Retains that great Amrut character.\\n\\n**87/100**\\n\\n*World Whisky Reviews #7-#8*\\n\\n*Indian Whisky Reviews #1-#2*\\n\\n*Whisky Network Reviews #12-#13*\",\n",
