Name is Laphroaig Triplewood
Review is I was lucky enough to enjoy four great samples of Laphroaig, the Select, the 10 Year Old, Quarter Cask and the Triple Wood. The 10 Year Old and the Quarter Cask we all know about, but the Triple Wood and the Select might be new to some. The NAS Select could be described as a Laphroaig Light, being matured in Oloroso sherry butts, PX seasoned hog heads and American bourbon casks. The former travel retail exclusive Triple Wood is matured in bourbon barrels, before transfer into quarter casks, and then a third maturation in Oloroso sherry European oak butts.

Review is I started a local Gentleman's Club at my office and we are holding a series of tastings. You can see in the image what was on the playlist, although we didn't do them in order, and the Glenlivet 18 will be sampled tonight, and wasn't tried last night. You can also see in the image the classy handmade leather-bound notebook with handmade recycled paper that I use exclusively for notes. Our club rates Scotch/Whiskey/Etc on a 0-5 "Monocle" scale (0 being denoted as "glasses"). I also have 1 0-10 rating to accommodate this subreddit, and ratings will be averaged with an interval of 5 points (You'll see). Note that I am rating these harshly, and 10/10 is purely theoretical. I am also rating these subjectively as this is my personal journal, although I do note what whiskeys are really good, but aren't "up my alley". The monocle rating is probably a bit more objective. Enough intro, let's begin!

Name is Dewar's 12
Review is I recently made a trip to the Party Source and came home with a great haul and a bunch of minis to try (plus one rather exciting bottle of 8 year old Highland Park IB). I decided I should put up some review of things that I’ve been milling over before I crack new bottles. 

It’s unavoidable that bottles I’ll be reviewing have been done before. But I’ve decided I can possibly add a new perspective to r/scotch by packaging some of my reviews as comparisons, when applicable. There are lots of reviews, for example, of Dewar’s 12, and countless ones of JW Black, but not so many that compare and contrast them thoroughly. And I guess there is the added benefit of less clutter on the front page.

**Atmosphere:** watching the batshit episode of Kitchen Nightmares that Reddit’s been buzzing about lately

**Glassware:** both are in brandy snifters (the little ones, not the ridiculous big pretentious balloon ones), left covered for 10 minutes before any real sniffing.

Name is Glenlivet Alpha
Review is 

The Glenlivet Alpha got some decent press a few months ago as one of the first single malts to be released with no tastings notes or information describing the whisky. It’s presented in a black bottle and is listed at 50% alcohol by volume. Eventually, more details about the whisky were released. Part of this whisky was aged in first fill bourbon barrels and the rest was aged in new American oak seasoned with whisky instead of wine. By that, I assume they mean single malt as ex-bourbon barrels are a dime a dozen. I’d be curious to know exactly what whisky was used. 

There’s no age statement on this, though from reading around online, I’m quite certain that this whisky is 14 years of age. It’s non-chill filtered and natural color.


**The Glenlivet Alpha – 50% ABV – 700 ml**

Name is Laphroaig 18
Review is Greetings Scotchit! So, due to the graciousness of /u/mattofmattfame, I will be the next centurion of this subreddit! Thanks dude, but we all know it could have been you! =) My first review was written on March the 4th, and was of the first Scotch I'd ever enjoyed, from a 200ml bottle I received for my birthday on the 16th of December, 2012: **Talisker 10**. It was a smoky revelation, and I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it completely changed my life.

Since then, I've tried well over a hundred whiskies of all sorts; I've written over a hundred reviews; I've gone to Islay; I've swapped with several of the awesome people who inhabit this subreddit; and I've amassed a pretty decent collection (for drinking purposes!) of whisky. It's been a pretty wild 9 months. Reading my first review now is rather amusing. My notes are pretty spot on, but my language was far more poetic. Perhaps that's a good thing? I also gave it an 88, which I think is about 3 points too high, but I still use Talisker as a baseline for my scores. Better than Talisker? Mid-80's.

Anyway, I've wondered what I'd review for #100, and could never really decide. Should I review something insanely old and expensive like a Port Ellen or the Caperdonich I just got? Should I re-review Talisker 10 and return to my roots? But no, for this one I decided to do a double header of the distillery I've reviewed the most, and one that I've sort of accidentally fallen in love with. I say accidentally, because whenever people asked me what my favourite distillery was, I'd say Talisker. And yet, I have a shelf stocked with Laphroaig 10, 10 CS, 15, 18, 23, PX, Cairdeas Portwood and Cairdeas Origins (holy shit, that's 8 bottles!); and I have 9 Laphroaig reviews in the archive.

Clearly, I love Laphroaig. And today I'm going to review another 2, to make over 10% of my Scotch reviews Laphroaig reviews. Anyway, enough rambling: **Laphroaig 15** and the bottling that replaced it: **Laphroaig 18**!

**Final remarks**:  

Thanks all for taking the time to read these reviews, I hope you enjoyed them or at least gained some insight into picking out your next bottle. 

It turns out I’m going to have to write 100 reviews before I attain the level of tartan that I want (it looks somewhat like my family tartan), so… I suppose I’ll have to get crackin’.

*Sláinte*, Scotchiteers—here’s to your next dram.

Review is Hello Scotchit. I apologise for not picturing bottles of the 15, 18 and 28. These were tried at a tasting event and it was only the 12 I decided to claim (best price to rating ratio in my opinion at the time, although now I regret not getting the 15 instead). If I’m not mistaken, these bottles are called the Singleton of Glendullan outside of the UK for reasons I’m not quite certain of (perhaps Dufftown sounds less appealing?).

Too bad.

for a bottle). However, what I can do is review three of the sample bottles they sent me and share my opinions on them. So, here they are.
For lack of another option, I'll arrange them by age.

Name is Port Ellen 22 1978 Rare Malts
Review is Greetings Scotchit! To bring me to 140 (and beyond!), I've got my notes from a very special tasting indeed... This was a tasting, organized by my whisky society, of 6 bottles of the Rare Malts series of bottlings. 

The Rare Malts series (if you didn't know) was one of the very first series of bottlings that embraced the true awesomeness of seriously aged, cask strength, non-chillfiltered and uncoloured single malt whisky in an age when the rest of the world was drinking almost exclusively blends. And most shockingly of all, it was created by Diageo. Yes, that Diageo.

The main tasting of the night was of 6 Rare Malts bottlings - most from the 70's, all cask strength, all non-chillfiltered, all uncoloured, all over 20 years old, most from dead distilleries. In addition, there were 4 more bottlings on offer a la carte, for a total of 10 incredibly rare whiskies - all of which are only available at auction today, all regularly auctioning for over €200 a bottle.

My notes are transcribed verbatim from my notebook, and recorded while drinking a 25ml glass, so they're not quite as detailed as my normal notes.

Was it incredible? Let's find out!

After the Pastor went home, the Engineer pulled out his latest acquisition from the duty free, the 10 year old offering from the Isle of Skye. A light coloured, thick legged beauty.
Our nosing and tasting discernment were getting a bit weak after 6 drams, but we still managed to pick up spiciness, pepper, peat smoke, brine and burnt sugar. The Engineer also commented that it reminds him of a richer, fuller version of the Te Bheag, which upon further exploration, turns out to be completely accurate as it does come from the Isle of Skye too! **Scored 90

The Glenmo Discovery Pack is a pretty neat deal as you get a full sized 750 ml of the original 10 year and one 50 ml bottle for each of the three expressions. They all are pretty decent but one, at least to me, is the clear winner. I really couldn't pass up the deal at

Review is Hello Scotchit! I've just watched my beloved Liverpool throw away the Premier League title, and so I need to do something else to take my mind off it. Scotch is always there for me. 




I'm a big fan of Bruichladdich because of their experimental nature. Somewhat disappointed (to put it lightly) at the recent announcement of a dramatic reduction in their range. Now I'm getting myself pissed off again, so I think it's time to move on to the reviews.  Slàinte mhath!

Review is Ahh Springbank...easily one of my favorite distilleries (Ralfy's favorite too). One of the few distilleries in Scotland that malts its own barley, and one of 3 Campbeltown distilleries as well, the other two being Glengyle/Kilkerran (also owned by Springbank) and Glen Scotia. Springbank does peat their whisky somewhat, but you will never confuse it with Ardbeg or Laphroaig. They also have a somewhat unique distillation process - Springbank is 2.5 times distilled - watch some Ralfy videos about it for more background - as opposed to the usual 2 most Scotch distillers do. Springbank distillery also makes the Longrow (more heavily peated) and Hazelburn (triple distilled) brands. All non chillfiltered/no color added. That said, I haven't cared about color forever. As for the notes...

Review is For a few years now, I would have called myself a “Rum drinker”, but that probably wasn’t totally accurate. I liked a few decent rums, and I could stand them neat. Recently I started trying other types of alcohol, and absolutely fell in love with Scotch. In my explorations I eventually stumbled across sherry Scotch (not all that hard to do really). Needless to say from the review pool, I am now a huge fan of Sherry Cask Scotches. I have a large “to get” list, and many of my purchases (and my future reviews) moving forward are going to involve broadening my selection and trying styles I have only had once or never at all. I feel I have reached a point now where my reviews may actually mean something, so here we go!


**Tasting Method:** .5 oz at a time, and 2.5oz total for each review. I revisited it across 5 nights to get the best perspective that wasn't tainted from one day.

At first, I meant to post this in April, when the tasting was held, but then I got lazy and then 200 started approaching and I couldn't really think of a much better way to ring in the new century than with a once-in-a-lifetime tasting.

This was an "Old Rarities" style tasting event, to which entrance cost €200 for which you got 2cl of 6 different drams and the whole thing was hosted by Magnus Markvardsen, Senior Brand Ambassador of Highland Park. 

What made it worth the price of entry, you might ask? Well, the first and most pedestrian whisky in the lineup was a Highland Park 25, bottled in 2004. Not a single rectangular bottle in the mix, either. So, was it epic?

Review is Hello Scotchit.

So a few evenings ago I had the pleasure of being introduced to what will now be for the foreseeable future, the single malt range from Mortlach. I’ve spent a considerable amount of time going through these reviews to be as honest about the *whisky* as I can be. I appreciate there’s been a lot of anticipation regarding these bottles, more to do with the surrounding “features” than anything else, I’m sure it would be a waste of characters to run through them all again, you all know what I’m talking about well enough by now. 

And so, I think it’s only right to write these reviews in a proper manor. Out goes my usual blathering about Diageo and it’s sacrilege of our beloved booze. In its place, reviews written as unbiased as possible with only the whisky in mind and a few facts and figures thrown in for good measure. A mini rant will surely follow afterwards.

I'm a big bourbon fan; for a long time I avoided Scotch because of the perceived barrier to entry (i.e., how much you need to pay to get something drinkable neat). I had high(ish) hopes that this exercise would prove that assumption wrong. Sadly, it did not.

Review is I've been wanting to pop my /r/Scotch cherry for a while, and with the Community Review coming up, I figured I'd do it with this JW vertical. I'm a little congested, so I may repeat the exercise down the line when I'm healthy, and if I can collect a few more expressions from Johnnie Walker.

Review is Hello Scotchit, Seienshin here with something I planned on doing a lot sooner, but first I was under the weather and later just plain lazy. Anyway, Balvenie gets lots of love around here and I have yet to be amazed by one of their offerings. To be fair, I’ve only had the 12 Double Wood and the 14 Caribbean Cask. Here’s some reviews!

Review is  Great stuff. Not too expensive and a nice step up from the 10. NCF and bottled at 48% this is great value. Not that offensive for a Lahproaig but a great dram nonetheless.

**Rating:**

Name is Jura 16
Review is Hello Scotchit, Seienshin here with another group review. I decided on a theme that really appeals to me: Older Island Malts. I have been on a trip to Islay with my father and brother, which were 3 days in the top 10 days of my life. I really love the Islay character of brine, sea salt and warming earthiness. Peated or unpeated: awesome whiskies. I don’t discriminate, so I reviewed other island malts as well. It includes all of Islay (except my beloved Kilchoman because the oldest Kilchoman I have is 7.5 years) as well as Orkney, Jura and the Isle Of Skye. I hope to get my hands on some Arran Devils Punchbowl next!

Also I couldn’t decide on a picture and I wasn’t going to upload 11 images, so here’s a pretty picture of the Isle of Skye instead.

 **Talisker 10** 45.8%. This is my third time trying Talisker 10 over the last year, and every time I've been mostly unimpressed with it. I'm happy that other people enjoy it more than I do, but for me it comes off as rough and muddled. I'd also rather go all the way on peat with Laphroaig 10 or Ardbeg 10 instead of a peat-tease like this.

Review is Hello scotchit! Today I'm doing a comparative review. The two malts in question are; Kilchoman 100% Islay and the other one is a Kilchoman Private Cask for Whiskysite.nl bottled from an ex-bourbon barrel at 60.4%.  
My only previous encounters with Kilchoman extends to when I reviewed the Kilchoman Machir bay 2013, which was very good, and when I reviewed the Kilchoman Port Cask, which was divine.

Review is  tvraisedme at the gates and clawing his way through some inventory and samples. Those of you playing at home, these are 58-61 for /r/scotch. Looking back, I haven't really reviewed anything in a while. One of my New Year's "I fucking doing this" Challenges is to hit the 100 club in reviews and work my way through my closet (my collection has outgrown my cabinets). These are the first of that. On the personal "I'm fucking doing this" Challenge front, I ran 5k in jsut under 31 minutes and did some weights. I haven't been to the gym since before Thanksgiving, with moderate running in between, so naturally I'm a slow, fat fuck right now. I haven't started reading my first book either, but week one is still not over yet, so there's still time. 

I'm so sure you all wanted to know this.

The 11yr. takes the top spot for me on this one.  The extra age and higher ABV really beefs up what's in the bottle. The standard bottling is O.K., with a thumbs up for offering craft presentation at a good price.

First things first, thanks to /u/jleese for the drams. I haven't had a Kilchoman I've not really really enjoyed, but I have avoided Machir bay.

Well I'm loving these comparsion reviews at the moment. Most notable from this was that I was able to really get to grips with what the Kilchoman house style is- really crisp, clean maritime peat. All of these were good, but the inaugural was a real cut above. 

Thanks for reading!

Name is Glen Moray Chardonnay Cask Finish
Review is First thing's first: how cool is that water glass? I got a bottle cutting kit and it's surprisingly easy and effective...at destroying all my nice bottles. But despite the high failure rate, a couple survived with a clean cut, and I hope to add some more to the collection. I don't imagine the paper labels will last long, but hopefully some of my embossed bottles will separate with a clean break. Does anyone here have experience with this and have some advice for increasing the success rate? /u/GWCad?

Anyways, on to the whisky. These two drams came from /u/tintin777 and are both from a distillery I've never tried before: Glen Moray. Sadly, they are diluted to the legal minimum of 40%, but one has 16 years in the barrel and the other has spend some time in a chardonnay cask which is another something new for me. 

Let's see how they are!

Review is Hi, I'm /u/LetThereBeR0ck. You may have read some of my reviews before. If you've read any of my GlenDronach reviews (or even some of the ones that aren't related to GlenDronach) you may have noticed that I love everything they make. 

Here's the thing though: you find a distillery you love and you get a bottle of each of their expressions and then...you go after the limited ones if you can get them? Maybe you re-buy your favorite of the lot and enjoy a second bottle. But at some point, you need a break. 

That's why I love single casks. A good distillery should be able to keep the quality high, while also ensuring that each one is unique. As it happens, GlenDronach has one of the best Single Cask product lines out there^according^to^me. There are both oloroso sherry single casks and PX sherry single casks. I love the former, and I'm fully enamored with the latter. 

Today I'm going to be comparing **FOUR**, count them, **FOUR** different Single Casks and all of them are PX Puncheon Casks. It's times like these that I'm so thankful to be a part of /r/scotchswap. I threw GlenDronach Cask Strength into the mix just to make it more difficult. 

Because I'm reviewing them blind. 

After writing all the reviews and guessing which one was my Cask Strength (wrong) and which one was my 17 Single Cask (right!) I checked to see which one was which. Then I ordered them from youngest to oldest, with the NAS Cask Strength first.

Name is Edradour 8 Barolo Cask Batch 2
Review is Edradour is one of those distilleries that sort of flies under the radar. I've had the standard 10 year before, but hadn't realized they had so many interesting expressions. While I was working out a swap with /u/_McFarland_, he posted reviews for the Barolo Cask and Caledonia which piqued my interest, so we worked samples of each of them into the trade. 

Additionally, I thought the Bordeaux Cask sounded good so I got a sample from fine drams. It looks like the Edradour Ballechins are yearly experimental releases with different casks. My understanding is that Ballechin was a distillery that shut down, so I'm guessing that Edradour absorbed what was left into their brand and release their whisky with that branding similarly to Bruichladdich Port Charlotte.

Review is Today I decided I wanted to try some single grain whisky. I opened my scotch cabinet and found three samples that are 23, 24, &amp; 25 years old. It gave me pause that maybe I have way too much scotch if I can sift through my samples and find *three* single grain whiskies. I'm not even sure if I've had one before, but what better way to get my feet wet than to compare three of them from distilleries I've never tried, blind? I'm up for the challenge!

P.S. Interestingly, the Wemyss Spice King actually states right on the bottle that coloring is added! I've never seem a bottle actually mention this; I've only seen them mention the opposite. I wonder if this is because of labeling laws in some of the countries where it's sold? Weird.

P.P.S. If either of these sound good to you, and you haven't ever tried Talisker 10 before, go out and buy it right now. It's probably the purest expression of what a "spice" malt should be.

Name is Ancient Ancient Age 10 Year
Review is 
**Conclusion:** This was an interesting comparison of two rather differently-styled bourbons. Up until the first little glass of each, I was ready to declare Sample II the winner. However, water killed sample II and really made Sample III shine. From that point on, even revisiting the whiskies sans water, I could only see II’s flaws and III’s strengths. 

For being a decently-made, seemingly high-rye bourbon with good drinkability, I give Sample II (Ancient Ancient Age 10 Year, 86 proof, $18.49/750mL at TPS) **80

Review is A group at work have started organizing some whiskey tastings, and for my first shot at organizing a menu I decided to go with my favorite bourbon distillery - Four Roses. Beyond making a great product, I find the history interesting too. Being bought out 70 years ago, and moving distribution all out of the US. Then, thanks to the work of the distillers, when they were bought out again in the early 2000’s, they brought distribution back to the US. 

The selection for the tasting were the 3 standard offerings of Four Roses, as well as Bulleit, since it also comes from the Four Roses distillery.

Name is Wild Turkey 101 8
Review is EDIT: Reviews #3 and #4 (does it count?) 


So I was in Duty Free the other month and I happen to saw the Wild Turkey 101 NAS. In my country they only sell the 8 year, so I thought for $25 for a 1L ain’t bad and I can finally compare. Also, seeing a post about OWA and OW 12 getting at 1:1 blend treatment made me do this here too, because, why not? 

Anyway, methodology is I had my sister pour at least an oz or more into glencairns (with a piece of paper below them) while I was out of the room, she then filled out another piece of paper on what she poured and gave it to me folded so I can see post tasting. I was in a bit of a hurry doing these, and such that I wanted to avoid most of the longer notes since these are whiskies everyone is familiar with, so this is more just to see what difference each had. Also caveat, being 101 proof each they all carried a lot of punch which might have affected subsequent tastings (I did this in order of ABC) although I did try to give at least 10 mins in between glasses.

I went to a local bar with a fantastic whiskey selection and the bartender was kind enough to pour me a half-glass of each of the three bourbons while I was in the bathroom so that I wouldn't know which bourbon was which. I took some notes as I was trying them, but since I was more focused on figuring out which was which instead of doing a proper review, they aren't very detailed.

Review is I’ve had a bottle of OGD 86 and 114 sitting on my shelf for a while, and I’ve never been able to pick up the Bottled in Bond that people tend to rave over here. For whatever reason, none of the ~8 stores I’ve been to in my general area have had any, although they’ve got the other two.

As a bit of a note, apparently the OGD 86 doesn’t exist any more, they’ve switched over to 80 proof as their low proof version as of this year. It says a good bit that I’ve had an almost empty bottle of the 86 for a while, when its been discontinued since the beginning of the year, according to Wikipedia. Nothing particularly interesting to talk about this Whiskey, other than its a higher rye, Beam mashbill.

On my way to see family for Thanksgiving, I stopped by a store that was advertising “whiskey sale”. Turns out when I got in they only had a couple of options, one of which the Bottled in Bond I’ve been trying to track down for a little while. Not to mention, I got the bottle for $18, which was a good rate for it.

Review is I meant to post these weeks ago, but life got in the way. After the amazing day at Four Roses with the Cask Force, I treated myself to a nice dinner at Bourbon's Bistro in Lousville. Coming from Charlotte where there are no good whiskey bars, the menu at this place was outstanding. Expensive, but outstanding.

My "unicorn" bottle has always been the Parker's 27, listed at $65 for a 2oz pour. Ouch. They also had the entire Van Winkle lineup, with 15/20 at $65 and the 23 at $100. However, the VWFRR was only $30 a pour, a relative steal. Plus, when asked they'll do 1oz pours at half price. Hooray! A good night was about to happen.

Leopold Brothers is based out of Denver, after they left Michigan because of its (at the time at least) unfriendly laws towards liquor production.

Name is Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch
Review is For reviews #7 and #8, I decided to do a side-by-side tasting of the Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch and Single Barrel, both of which I received samples of courtesy of /u/Randimosity. My first review was of the E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof, which I really like, and I’m planning to try the Rye and the Tornado for upcoming reviews but wanted to try these two side-by-side since they seem to be the two most similar offerings in Buffalo Trace’s E.H. Taylor line.

The line is named after Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr., whose great uncle was President Zachary Taylor.  To quote the Buffalo Trace website: “As founding father of the bourbon industry, Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr. left an indelible legacy. His dedication to distilling began at the close of the Civil War when he purchased O.F C. Distillery . There, he developed innovative techniques that are still in use today. Made by hand, this Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey has been aged inside century old warehouses constructed by E.H. Taylor, Jr.  Barrels are evaluated and selected to create a perfect blend of distinctive character that is like no other. This bourbon is a true sipping bourbon that honors the uncompromising legacy of E.H. Taylor, Jr. …  E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel is aged exclusively in Warehouse C, which was built by Taylor in 1881 and proven to be an excellent aging warehouse. Each barrel is hand-picked and Bottled in Bond at 100 proof to honor its namesake.” The O.F.C. Distillery (Old Fire Copper Distillery) burnt down in 1882 and Taylor was forced to borrow money from his friend George T. Stagg to rebuild.  Taylor ultimately was not able to repay the debt and Stagg foreclosed, taking control of Taylor’s Carlisle Distillery and a number of related brands. The company would change hands a number of times, be led by Albert Blanton at one point, produce “medicinal spirits” during prohibition, at one point be named the Ancient Age distillery and finally make its way into the hands of the Sazerac Companies, who changed the name to Buffalo Trace in 1999.

As noted above, an important part of that “indelible legacy” was the creation of the “bottled in bond” concept, implemented as a means to ensure quality control for bourbon at a time when standards were inconsistent and consumers couldn’t be sure exactly what they were getting when they were buying whiskey – through the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897 and subsequent iterations of the law, the government set down regulations that must be followed to be labeled as “bottled-in-bond” and gives a governmental stamp of approval for the whiskey inside the bottle. To quote Wikipedia: “To be labeled as Bottled-in-Bond or Bonded, the liquor must be the product of one distillation season (January to December) and one distiller at one distillery. It must have been aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years and bottled at 100 (U.S.) proof (50% alcohol by volume). The bottled product's label must identify the distillery where it was distilled and, if different, where it was bottled. Only spirits produced in the United States may be designated as bonded.”  Although any spirit can technically by labeled as “bottled-in-bond”, in practice most bonded spirits are whiskey. Among Taylor’s other innovations was being credited with being the first to put steam heat in his brick warehouses to control aging.

So some caveats and thanks are in order. 

30 Minutes of air time, around an ounce and a half each. I’ve opened the 137 in advance a few weeks ago but just got a dram. The Batch 1, although I have my own bottle now, was a sample that /u/dryeager generously included when he forwarded me Batch 2 (my first ECBP). Batch 3 I owe a great deal of thanks to /u/zpenci for very very generous forwarding also when I PMd him. He was kind enough to buy me 2! Really stand out guys!

I’m down on my luck on bourbons where I am (Philippines), and the only chance I get to try rare sought after releases such as these are with the kindness of strangers (wink?). On with the reviews!

Also, all the phtos are at the image link. I’ll refer to them especially on the color.

This then is a blind tasting of the famous and much sought after Buffalo Trace wheated mashbill.  Last weekend I started this tasting, which I'd promised myself way back [last fall](http://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/2q8xp6/as_a_newbie_to_the_bourbon_scene_i_was_unaware/) when I scored a few nice finds and decided to [complete](http://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/2qxzpy/achievement_unlocked_level_three_complete/) the [family](http://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/2rwwvd/really_bad_photo_of_the_contents_of_a_couple/).

Name is Jameson
Review is Greetings World Whisky! Today I'm bringing you notes from a Jameson tasting that my girlfriend and I attended tonight. Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture, so Jameson stock photo will have to do. I wasn't a huge fan of Jameson Original after a few drinks, but I think my archived score is more representative of my surprise of how not terrible it was when I first tried it.

Regardless, I was willing to give Jameson a shot, so when my whisky society informed me of this tasting, I was in. The tasting was hosted by a recent graduate who was serving as the Jameson brand ambassador in Finland for a year, who was a very pleasant (if somewhat inexperienced) Irish girl, without the exaggerated, sexy Irish accent. 

She gave us an initial presentation about the production of Irish whiskey and people asked a few questions, only one of which she wasn't at liberty to discuss. Specifically, I asked what proportion of Jameson was grain whisky, and that's apparently where they clam right the fuck up - ironic, since they gave a presentation about how important barley and water are to their process. I guess neutral grain spirits aren't that sexy.

Regardless, here are my thoughts on the five whiskies we tried, in order of expense, but reverse order of reviewing.

I've been a bit (read: a lot) lazy about transcribing the reviews from the tastings I've attended, but the community review of Green Spot prompted me to write up this tasting, because it conveniently includes a review of Green Spot as well as several other single pot still whiskies. 

Specifically, it was a tasting conducted by the Jameson brand ambassador in Finland and included just about the full range of Midleton Distillery single pot still whiskies (they of Jameson, Redbreast, et al fame). Did any of them impress me?

Glen Moray is a speyside distillery that has gone through a few different ownership groups, but can trace its origins back to 1897.

Name is Lagavulin 12 Cask Strength 2019 Release
Review is **Introductory Comments**:  This side-by-side review closes out a short series of reviews I've done in which I looked at cask strength, peated single malts from [Caol Ila](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/la49z6/review_121_signatory_vintage_cs_caol_ila_20102020/), [Octomore](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/lep8c0/review_122_octomore_104/), [Highland Park](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/lmski7/review_123_highland_park_cask_strength_release_no/), and [Kilchoman](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/loztac/review_124_kilchoman_machir_bay_cask_strength/).  I'm wrapping up this series with a bang by looking at the three recent releases of Lagavulin 12, which might be the most consistent bottling year after year in this category.

Last year I chose the 2018 version of Lagavulin 12 for my [100th review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/expgl6/review_100_lagavulin_12_2018_release/).  Since then, I was able to obtain samples of the 2019 and 2020 releases, and with my 2018 bottling still about half full, I was able to carry out a couple of side-by-side tastings to directly compare the three releases.  Out of 124 whisky reviews thus far, the 2018 release of Lagavulin 12 is tied with two others for my highest score, so it is a bottling that I hold in very high regard.  

I will begin by re-posting my tasting notes from my original 2018 review, since I found them to still be representative of the impressions I got during these tastings.  I'll then give my tasting notes for the 2019 and 2020 and conclude by giving my overall impressions of how the three of them compare.

Name is Starward Single Malt
Review is Back with another installment of MoM's gone wild, in which I review lots of samples I recently purchased off Master of Malt when I splurged perhaps a bit too much and bought pretty much anything that was being produced in a country that is not necessarily known for whisky production.  Today I've got two different releases from Starward.  For those of you who don't know anything about Starward, it comes from New World Distillery in Victoria.  Most Australian whisky comes from Tasmania, and is expensive.  New World sought to make a good Australian whisky that was sold at affordable prices.  So they set out to do it back in 2007.  The first whisky I've got is their standard release, which is made from Australian malted barley and aged in Australian apera (Australia's version of sherry) casks.  The other whisky I've got here is their 10th anniversary release, which is a vatting of 28 different casks and includes some amount of whisky from the eight different types of casks used across the distillery's history.  For those of you more versed in Starward's history, you may know what these are.  I do not, but I was able to find that there is at least some Apera, red wine, and PX from jerez casks.

Review is Thanks to /u/scotchable for the samples.   Workshops whisky is produced in Christchurch, New Zealand.  They begin distilling in 2012 using locally sourced Kiwi barley.  The first sample I have is some of their regular release, which was aged for 3 years in virgin French oak casks.  The second sample I have is a cask strength single barrel version of the same specs that was selected specially for DramFest 2018.

Name is Heartwood Darkest Before Dawn
Review is Thanks to /u/theslicknick6 for the samples.  Heartwood is a product that I've wanted to get my hands on for a long time, and now I have 3.  They are an independent bottler out of Australia, who age and bottle other Aussie whiskies.  The first, Heartwood @#$%^&, was aged for 7 years in second fill port, and 3 years in two different first fill sherry casks.  The whisky itself came from Sullivan's Cove Distillery.  The second one I've got, Heartwood Darkest Before Dawn, came from Lark Distillery and was aged in an oloroso sherry cask for 8.5 years.  It is peated using Sphagnum peat.  The final whisky, Heatwood Shade of Night, also comes from Lark, also is peated with Sphagnum peat, and also aged for approximately 8 years in an ex-sherry cask.

Name is Macallan 12 Sherry
Review is **Introductory Comments**:  Several weeks ago I picked up a half-sized bottle of *The* Macallan 12 Sherry Oak, and I was stunned by how good it was.  I frequently order this as a drink when I'm dining out, so I knew what to expect, and this bottle surpassed my expectations.  I looked on the inside of the bottle to get the lot code, and with the help of this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/7xtu4k/complete_list_of_macallan_year_codes/) by /u/jrsheppa and an eventual written confirmation from the distillery itself, I determined that my bottle was actually bottled in January 2012!

Not long thereafter, I went back to the same store and got another half-bottle, thinking it would be from the same batch.  But as it turns out, it was actually bottled in October 2013.  The surprising thing was that it was noticeably different than the January 2012 bottle, and was overall significantly less enjoyable.  I am fascinated by the subject of batch variation from year to year, so I thought it would be interesting to pick up a newer bottle to compare to these two older ones.  To do this, I picked up a full bottle that was bottled in November 2017, which allows me carry out a side-by-side horizontal of three Macallan 12 Sherry Oak expressions spanning a time period of nearly six years from January 2012 to November 2017.

Name is Caol Ila 11 2007 SMWS 53.302 "Holy sweet smoke"
Review is I wanted to do something special for 200 and these two were something I had really been looking forward to trying side by side since I got them. These are two Caol Ilas from the SMWS that were distilled on the same date and have the same age statement. SMWS tragically does not give the bottling date like some other IBs so I don’t know that they spent quite the same amount of time in their respective casks, but they will be within a year of each other. These sister casks are both the same type and the casks were so similar that the difference in bottle outturn is just 1. The names given suggest wildly different flavors (within a specific flavor profile) and it’s very exciting to see just how different two casks can be.

Welcome to my double review of these to lovely expressions from Ardbeg. We all know Ardbeg. It's on Islay. It's peated. It's quality nice. I have once tried the Ardbeg Ten in a specialist shoppe, and I was quite underwhelmed then. Perhaps it needs more nursing than a quick sample.  
Anyway, my mate and I went to a pub today - he owed me a dram - and I decided to order one of each so we could swap halfway through. On with the reviews! Skål!

My first two reviews.  I've been drinking scotch for a year or so now and have a pretty good idea of what I like.  These were not my first bottles of Ardbeg, I've had the 10 before, so I figured I'd start with something somewhat familiar.  I would like to refine my palette so I thought forcing myself to write something down about what I was drinking might help.  I find it hard to describe this sort of thing, so I'm not expecting to be very good at this starting out.  I reviewed the Ardbeg 10, cleansed my palette, and moved on to the Uigeadail.

A few months back I was lucky enough to attend a tasting event put on by Gordon and MacPhail in which Richard Urquhart – great-grandson of John Urquhart who helped the company specialise in single malts back in 1915.  Richard is a stand-up gent who shared some great anecdotes and made me appreciate the G&M / Benromach legacy and what they stand for in the production and/or bottling of single malts.  I’m only now getting around to typing up my notes, so I’m relying on them to type up these reviews.

Name is Old Pulteney 26 1989 Vintage
Review is This past Monday night one of our local whisky bloggers (Gal from whiskyisrael.co.il) put on an Old Pulteney tasting. Aside from the 12, 17 and 21 year old expressions which are the ones sold here, he also brought in a bottle of the 1989 LE and the 35yo. The importer just started selling the 17 and 21 year olds a few months ago and has really priced them fairly, which is very unusual (sadly), so one of their reps was in attendance, and brought along some Hankey Bannister 21yo which I reviewed earlier this week.

These whiskies are all matured in a mix of ex-bourbon (the vast majority in all expressions) and sherry casks (the 21yo specifically Oloroso, the 17 in a mixture of mainly Oloroso and few PX casks if I'm not mistaken, not sure about the 35). The 1989 Limited edition was matured in casks that previously held a heavily peated whisky.

I reviewed the 17yo so it won't be reviewed here.

Name is Compass Box Flaming Heart 2015 
Review is *Here’s some info regarding the Flaming Heart series straight from Compass Box:*

Our fifteenth anniversary release is a huge, layered, long-lasting mouthful of a whisky to enjoy late into the night. Brooding, indulgent and older than ever before, this is a whisky born of oak, smoke and fire – with a big heart all of its own.

First released in 2006, Flaming Heart was the first whisky to combine the rich, complex spice of Scotch aged in new French oak with the evocative peat-fired smoke of Islay malt. It created a genre-defying style that was smouldering, spicy, complex – and so popular that we’ve re-released it four more times in the years that followed.

*You can find all the info you might want right on CB's website, they are awesomely open about their blends. Anyway, I was very lucky to split a bottle of the 15th with /u/dustlesswalnut and /u/PeatReek sent me a sample of the 10th a while back - thank you both! I tried the two SbS briefly with dustless a while back, and remember liking the 10th just a little more. Let’s see how they compare in a ‘semi-blind’ setting...*

*What that means is that I labeled the bottom of two Glencairns and poured 1oz samples, then moved them around a bunch and let them rest for 20 minutes. I couldn’t remember which is which by the time I came back to the glasses.*

We were only stopping in for a nip before crossing the street to see *There Will Be Blood.* Needless to say, I was instantly a fan of Talisker and single malts in general. In celebration of that fateful day here are my takes on four offerings from that famous Skye distillery.

Review is Welcome ScotchIt readers. I've been doing reviews in /r/WorldWhisky for a while now, and thought it was time I started contributing some of my scotch whisky reviews here. Hope you find them interesting


To start, here are Caol Ila's entry-level 12yo and aged 30yo official bottlings.  A high-capacity distillery from Islay using mainly peated malt, most of Caol Ila's production is directed into Diageo's high-volume blends like Johnnie Walker Black and Bell’s. While many consider Caol Ila's standard range to be "lightly peated", they actually use a comparable level of peat to Lagavulin. Presumably, there are other aspects to whisky production here that attenuate the effect of peat on final whisky flavour.

Name is Glenlivet 12
Review is ~~~~

Like for many, the Glenlivet 12yo was the first single malt Scotch that I would routinely order in a bar, neat. It was a considerable step up from the basic whisky blends I had tried (both domestic and international), and had a relatively gentle and inoffensive flavour profile.


Founder's Reserve is a slightly cheaper new NAS from Glenlivet, and one that immediately replaced the 12yo in some smaller and emerging markets.  While the two expressions are currently both still available here in Canada, that may be changing – the expectation is that the Founder's Reserve will replace the 12yo in most markets eventually.


Of course, most of us soon move on from these relatively inexpensive single malts, searching for wider flavour experience.  But given their ubiquity, I thought it was worth providing a head-to-head comparison.

Name is GlenDronach 12 Original
Review is I hoped to get to Glendronach and Glenfarclas today but didn't have time in the end. So I did the tour at Glendronach and went to The Whisky Shop Dufftown.

Glendronach is a super traditional distillery. I hadn't realised fully. Floor maltings until 1996, cast iron traditional mash tun, wooden washbacks and the stills were direct fired until 1996ish I think as well. Do correct me if I'm wrong.

Nice tour (I was the only one on it too) but I was driving, so had to take my 12yo away in a bottle.

However, I did bottle my own from the distillery cask. A 2004 Sherry Puncheon. Little on the expensive side at £84 but hopefully worth it.

After that I went into Dufftown where the whisky shop has a big selection (600) and you can try just about anything! Again though, driving. So I bought the 18yo Smokehead at £92 which is pretty good these days (I've seen it at £130). I also asked if I could take a small sample of their exclusive Glenfarclas family cask, which they very kindly let me.

After all that I thought I might as well head back to Gordon & MacPhail and try even more whisky!

Name is Springbank 17 1998 Malts of Scotland
Review is This month our whisky club met up at the awesome Whiskey Bar & Museum in Tel Aviv. This month our theme was Springbank. The disitllery has a lot of fans in the club and rightly so, they make consistently good whiskies, and are always playing around with cask types and barley sources, leading to some very interesting expressions.
This time we got to try the following expressions:

•	**100 Proof:** This is a mid-2000's bottling of a high ABV, 10 year old. This was discontinued a few years ago but bottles were still available here and there until recently. Note that it's 100 (imperial) proof so 57%ABV, not cask strength.

•	**12-year-old Calvados Wood:** Now then and Springbank experiment with different types of casting and release the results as part of their wood range. This particular one spent 6 years in first fill bourbon casks before spending another 6 years in Calvados (apple brandy) casks, quite an unusual cask type for whisky.

•	**13-year-old Green:** Springbank's Green expressions are a series of releases of whisky made using organic barley. This one is from 2015 and was matured in sherry casks.

•	**1998 Malts of Scotland Botting:** A 17-year-old independent bottling of Springbank matured in a sherry hogshead.

Name is Springbank 10 100 Proof
Review is This month our whisky club met up at the awesome Whiskey Bar & Museum in Tel Aviv. This month our theme was Springbank. The disitllery has a lot of fans in the club and rightly so, they make consistently good whiskies, and are always playing around with cask types and barley sources, leading to some very interesting expressions.

Name is Jura 16 Diurach's Own
Review is Jura is very much a marmite whisky with people generally divided into those who love it and those who hate it. I generally fall into the former camp although I do think it needs to be aged a little or be peated to truly bring it its character. I fell in love with Jura when I tried their Superstition expression a few years back. That particular one declined a little in my opinion, but I’m still a fan.

This post is a collection of notes from a Jura tasting I attended at Whisky Live in June and from a sample of the 30-year-old very generously provided by Yoav from [Whisky Gospel]( https://whiskygospel.com/).

First up is the Brora pair I bought for my birthday this year.  Both are vintage 1981, matured in sherry, and 21 years old.  They are from different independent bottlers, however.  I've been working on these for a while and am nearing the end.  They've been reviewed here before, most notably by [j4ni](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3zcjzg/the_allinclusive_luxury_third_week_at_deer_camp/).

As /u/j4ni already mentioned, I was born in 1981.  Since my last birthday, I've been keeping an eye out for something to pour this Feb, and in the summer I picked up the Signatory bottle (A).  After the purchase, I tracked down a few reviews | [1](http://myannoyingopinions.com/2013/10/14/brora-21-1981-cask-1586-signatory-ucf/) | [2 by our own u/madgraf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3g08zl/review_134_brora_21_signatory_19812003/) | [3 *isn't an exact match to the cask number](http://www.whiskyfun.com/archiveapril07-1.html#010407) | and was... underwhelmed.

Review is Once again, our whisky club, [Malt Mongers Israel]( https://www.facebook.com/MMI.Whisky/), met up at the Milk & Honey distillery for our monthly get together. This month’s theme was Campbeltown without Springbank. We’d recent had a dedicated Springbank evening and decided to try some of the other whiskies coming from the region (granted only one bottle was not from a Springbank associated distillery).

I was quite excited as my experience with Hazelburn, Longrow and independently bottled Glen Scotias is quite limited. Our lineup for the evening was:

* Hazelburn 10 Rundlets and Kilderkins – A Special release of Springbank’s triple distilled, unpeated label. It was matured in 60 litre rundlets and 80 litre kilderkins, hence the name. They’re actually wine and beer casks respectively, although I couldn’t find info as to whether the casks used here contained those fluids before being used to mature whisky.

* Kilkerran 12 – Already reviewed here, the excellent first full-fledged release of whisky distilled at Springbank owned Glengyle distillery.

* Glen Scotia 1991 bottled by Signatory Vintage – A 22 year old independently bottled Glen Scotia, matured in a hogshead, bottled at a slightly perturbing 43% ABV.

* Longrow 18 – The 2014 release of the older expression of Springbank’s heavily peated label.

There was also a bottle of Campbeltown Loch (a blend put out by Springbank), seen in the picture which was not part of the evening but was kindly brought by one of the members for everyone to try, so didn’t take notes on that one.

Name is Finlaggan Old Reserve
Review is This past week I attended a whisky tasting at Rozner’s Cellar in Kfar Saba. It’s a pretty interesting alcohol shop, they have a fair collection (by Israeli standards) of older whiskies including some real oddities, like a bottle of the Bailie Nicol Jarvie blend. They also hold the occasional tasting, this being the second I’ve attended there.

This time we were tasing a range of peated whiskies from The Vintage Malt Whisky Co. They’re an independent who bottle several single malt whiskies as undisclosed malts under their own labels, with the emphasis on providing accessible, but good quality whiskies. They’re also responsible for a number of regional market specific brands and the very good Cooper’s Choice single cask range.

The whiskies available for tasting were:

• Islay Storm – A non-age stated undisclosed single malt from Islay, on the lower end of the price point. Most opinions I’ve seen say it’s either a Caol Ila or Bowmore.

• Finlaggan Old Reserve – Another non-age stated undisclosed single malt from Islay, this is quite a widely available one, also at a budget price.The Finlaggan brand is quite a veteran one and the distillery that it originates from has long been the subject of speculation. Most of the opinions I’ve seen point to Lagavulin or Caol Ila.


• Finlaggan Eilean Mor – This is an “enhanced” version of the basic Finlaggan, bottled at 46% ABV instead of 40% and apparently non-chill filtered (doesn’t say on the label, but the importer’s rep doing the tasting said it was and it certainly felt 

• The Ileach – Another veteran label, named for the term used to refer to someone from Islay. This too is a non-age stated Islay single malt whose origins are hidden, said to be Lagavulin or Bowmore.


• The Ileach Cask Strength – This version of the Ileach is boosted up to cask strength for extra oomph.

• Blackface Charred Stock – Named after a prized breed of Scottish sheep, this is a bit of an odd one out here. It’s a blended malt made up primarily of  Talisker, Caol Ila, Glenrothes, Linkwood and Longmorn. The Charred Stock version is so named because it was matured in heavily charred casks.

One thing I must point out is that my notes might not be so good because I had a very hard time concentrating on the whisky. Unfortunately a bunch of guys had showed up to the tasting who had no interest in tasting, the downed the first 3 glasses right at the start, got pretty damn drunk and shouted over the poor guy trying to do the tasting the whole time. Everyone else complained, to which the drunk bastards replied with nothing but insults, but nothing was done about it. Was a really shitty experience.

Taken together, it is no contest – the Glen Garioch 1995 is a superior malt.  However, at twice the price, I suspect most would rather pick up the Benromach 10 as a go-to dram.  I'm seriously tempted to pick up one of the last remaining bottles of the GG though …

Name is Glenfiddich Special Old Reserve 1980's Bottling
Review is Hey everyone,

Glenlivet yesterday, Glenfiddich today. Again, one of the most recognised brands and one that is often cited as a good beginner malt. I normally find it has a similar profile to Glenlivet but with more fruit and less floral notes. 

Interstingly, despite being *huge* and making a metric shit-tonne (technical term) of whisky, they still have small direct fired stills, which should give it a more traditional character. Although, I think the only time it can show itself off is at higher strength. 

As with Glenlivet, I’m not a huge fan of Glenfiddich, even the older stuff. Never really bottled above 40%, I feel like the character of the spirit is normally too muted. Anyways, here’s my reviews:

Some quick Cragganmore today. Did you know they have worm tubs? Which should create a more intense, meaty style. Like Mortlach, Talisker or Benrinnes. Alas, Diageo have seen fit to release this at 12 years old at 40%, so it's never really achieved the status of the others.

I love Islay but don’t really love Bunna.

I’ve said before that Bunna isn’t my favourite distillery. It’s probably my least favourite Islay. I find a biting harshness in just about any bottling, maybe it’s just not for me. I guess it saves it for the people who enjoy it anyway and I know a lot of people do. 

Today we’ve got an indie and two officials, let’s go by age.

Review is This week [Malt Mongers Israel (MMI)](https://www.facebook.com/MMI.Whisky/) met up once again to share some good whisky and good company.  This month’s theme was older blended whiskies. We thought it might be fun to try some better quality blends which might often be overlooked in favour of single malts.

Blends have always been the real core of the whisky market, this hadn’t changed much with the rising popularity of single malts but they have become less popular with the hardcore whisky geeks so there aren’t very many niche blends out there, particularly well aged ones.

Age can take off the nasty edge in the grain components used for blending and a well aged, well made blend can actually be quite a fine whisky (so can some younger blends if the components are all good).

Got some older Linkwood for your reading pleasure today. As with most of them, it is an interesting distillery I didn’t really know enough about.

It’s owned by Diageo and actually I have visited it, briefly sitting in the car park. It doesn’t have a visitor’s centre, or really many official bottlings. Mostly because they need it for the blends. Luckily, there does seem to be a good availability with the independent bottlers.

These are all Scottish cheeses & one of the cheddars is made from the milk of cows that were fed on draff from a Campbeltown distillery. Draff is the leftover barley after it has been steeped in hot water to extract its sugar - it remains high in fibre & protein and is sold to farmers as feed for livestock.

Review is I was going to try and line up my 250th scotch review with my 400th network-wide review, but then a couple of [Toronto Whisky Society](http://www.torontowhiskysociety.ca) events and group reviews upped my r/worldwhisky and r/bourbon totals too high for the scotch reviews to catch up. so, instead my 400th network review is #242 on r/scotch. C'est la vie avec l'eau de vie! Decided to review a couple bottles that have been with me for a while, through my whisky journey: my 2 solera bottles. I started these in May 2014, so some of the juice in there has been marrying for nearly 3 years. My life has changed quite a bit since then... the girl I had just started dating is now my wife of over a year, I moved from my hometown to Toronto, changed roles at my job a couple times, posted 350+ reviews on the network, co-started a whisky blog and society... it's been a good 3 years. From these bottles, I've taken out drams over time, but generally the proportions stayed true, so my calculations of ABV should be close. For each one, unpeated and peated, I've provided a breakdown of what went into the bottle, my projected ABV and what the score would be if the sum was equal to the weighted value of its parts. I'll review this taking typical tasting notes, but for scoring, will compare it to that expected value to see if the bottle was a success or failure. So without further rambling, here's my 400th and 401st network reviews: Muaddib99's Unpeated and Peated Solera Bottles.

Review is Good guys Bruichladdich have given us a second chance at the discontinued 10 year age stated Laddie with the "Second Limited Edition" release. I still had some of the original 10 year left, so I thought it would be fun to compare the two releases. I had a sample of The Classic Laddie too that I received from u/taddraughn, so I threw that into the mix as well. While it is technically a NAS bottle, you can look up the vatting info on the Bruichladdich website and most bottles I've seen are made up of 7-10 year old Whisky. These are all NCF and NCA, and drank as is with no water added.

Full disclosure here, I'm a big Bruichladdich and Laddie fanboy. So if you're looking for an objective and impartial analysis of these bottles, look elsewhere!

Overall conclusion: Usually I’m a sherry guy but the bourbon cask version was the clear winner for me. The cask strength was probably one factor. It was more pleasant overall with more flavor and a better mouthfeel.

Granted, this was after a few drinks, so probably not the most reliable of reviews. When I [visited Islay last June with my wife](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/2016/06/27/bryans-trip-to-scotland-part-3-laphroaig-ardbeg-lagavulin/), we went to Laphroaig, and claimed the rent for our square foot of land in their peat bogs. When I got home, we saw that the mini bottle they gave was bottled at 40% ABV, while the bottle on my shelf was 43%. So today, as I drain both bottles, we're gonna do a quick comparison of the two, side by side to see if that 3% makes any significant difference. My assumption going in is there will be very little difference between the two.

Name is Lagavulin 16
Review is **

A lot of comparisons have been made between these two versions of Lagavulin, but honestly I don't feel that it's totally fair. These are two very different Whiskies that seem to be directed at two different markets. The 16 is elegant and inviting, the smokiness is interwoven with rich and sweet flavors, it manages to be really good and interesting while still having mass appeal. It does suffer from the low ABV, but that also makes it more palatable to drinkers looking for a "smooth" Whisky.

The 12CS on the other hand is a clean, sleek bullet train of cask strength briny peat, the kind of stuff we true connoisseurs(aka insufferable snobs) live for. It's NCF and NCA to really drive the point home that "hey everybody, this is the GOOD shit!" And it really is so good, it scratches my Islay itch in a way the 16 just doesn't. But for the price (I get the 16 for half the price of the 12CS) I'd rather keep the 16 around, especially for guests since it's such a recognizable and drinkable Scotch.

Score: 

Lagavulin 16: **6**

I’ve got some new stuff from those dapper fellows at Springbank. They seem to be doing a lot recently with Hazelburn, Springbank, Longrow, kilkerran and a string of releases from Cadenhead’s for their 175th Anniversary. 

Needless to say, whisky fans are lapping it up. Mainly because the stuff these guys are releasing is good quality, age stated and reasonably priced. Thank god there’s at least one company left doing us proud.

More whisky from my birthday on Tuesday, this time the Scotch’s.

Sample of the Aberlour obtained via r/scotchswap from /u/Ethanized. As I prepare for my trip to Scotland in a few weeks, I'm working through my remaining samples. Best to have a better idea what to look for when I'm there.  I didn't intend this as a side by side, but half way through the Aberlour I wanted to compare it to something. Got some Macallan 12 and here we are.  But that's why there's no picture of the Macallan. 

Consumed neat in a Copita and a similar stemless glass.  I felt like a different glass tonight.  


**abv**: 48% for the Aberlour. 43% for Macallan 

**color** Golden amber, with light pinkish hue from the sherry casks. Aberlour is a little darker and more pink.

On our tour at Glenfarclas we met some great Canadian’s, who invited us to join them at the Mash Tun. If you don’t know it, it’s a famous whisky bar and restaurant/pub in Aberlour. Since we were staying near Aberlour it seemed like a good idea, as me and u/generalbirdy wanted to go there at some point anyway.

Food at the Mash Tun was good, but the whisky selection is great, including a Glenfarclas Family Cask from every year since 1953. From there we then headed to the Aberlour Hotel for a very reasonably priced Balvenie 15 Single Barrel.

For the last night of the trip, of course we had to head back to the Craigellachie Hotel for another round of epic whisky tasting.

I wouldn’t say *Ar-ran* all the way there, but we were pretty eager to get back!

We got there after 8pm and stayed till closing, which was 1am, when we had to throw in the *Tomin-towel*. Unfortunately, a wedding party came in at 12:58 and I’m pretty sure Lyndsey was up, keeping them happy for another few hours. We felt really guilty, if it weren’t for us maybe she could have closed just before they arrived!

At least for us, it was another great night of chatting, tasting and laughing (mostly at whisky related puns).

Name is Glenburgie 24 1992 Cadenhead's Small Batch
Review is So after quite a long break our local whisky club, [Malt Mongers Israel \(MMI\)](https://www.facebook.com/MMI.Whisky/), met up to try some more fine whisky. The theme this time was Cadenhead, the independent bottler owned by the same bunch of people as Springbank.


Cadenhead is quite a reputable bottler with their own maturation warehouses and some amazing stock to draw from. We were trying some older bottlings from their “Small Batch” range all of which to the best of my knowledge were bourbon cask matured. There was a 24 year old Bruichladdich, a Linkwood whose age I frogot and these two which I took notes for, a 25 year old Glen Grant and a 24 year old Glenburgie.

Glen Grant is fairly well known from their distillery bottlings, the common NAS version being one of the cheapest single malts in many markets, but it would be interesting to try something older and without all that deplorable treatment such as dilution and chill-filtration.

Glenburgie is somewhat more obscure, not really having any distillery bottlings, but I have seen some very good reviews recently so was excited to try it.

You might notice from the pictures that the distillery names have a “-Glenlivet” tacked onto them. This is quite an interesting little piece of whisky history that I  don’t remember if I’ve mentioned before. Glenlivet is a region within Speyside and was used as a labelling term long before the SWA and their regions. The Glenlivet Distillery made a big fuss about getting exclusive rights to the term “The Glenlivet” and since then a lot of the distilleries who previously used the term could only hyphenate it onto their own name, so the use of the term has slowly fallen out of use. A number of distilleries still do it, mainly those that were well known before the term Speyside became a thing, where it was used to distinguish themselves from the Highland malts.

Anyways, on to the whiskies:

Review is Thanks to /u/theslicknick6 for the DNA 3 sample.  I purchased a sample of DNA 4 from whiskysite.nl to compare.  And /u/sirboulder and I got together to do a little tasting the other night (along with some of his Valinch bottle that he generously shared).  These were both distilled in 1985.  The DNA 3 was matured for 25 years in ex-sherry casks and the DNA 4 was matured for 27 years in ex-bourbon casks.  DNA 3 was bottled at 50.1% and DNA 4 was bottled at 49.3%.  No added color and non-chill filtered.

Review is The other day, /u/devoz /u/tomodera and I got together to do some planning for the [Toronto Whisky Society's](http://torontowhiskysociety.ca) upcoming events and to drink a bunch of Ledaig, the peated offering from the Tobermory distillery. As we have a custom bottling now from Tobermory, we figured a Ledaig line-up was appropriate, and as someone who hasn't reviewed a single Ledaig in nearly 300 previous scotch reviews, I was happy to participate!. Devoz had a few on his kill pile and a few that he loves and wanted to share, so we were lucky enough to be the beneficiaries!

Overall Thoughts:  The 13, 19, and 23 all had a lot of resemblance to each other.  The 17 kind of stepped out of the mold.  It should be noted that the other two guys in the group were much bigger fans of the 17 than I was, and both rated it as 2nd behind the 23.  The 11 doesn't even belong in the same sentence as the rest of them.

Name is Glenrothes 12 2005 Old Particular #DL11601
Review is Our whisky club, Malt Mongers Israel, usually takes a break in August, but we had a special ad hoc meeting this month and with good reason. Independent bottlings are making a return to our shelves! Sipil, a local online store and importer which is very familiar to all the hardcore whisky geeks here, has begun importing Douglas Laing’s range.

This is not the first time Douglas Laing has been brought to our shores, but the previous attempt saw a very limited number of bottlings making their way over, and thus failed to garner much interest.

Yigal from Sipil organised this evening for us where we could try all of the initial range of stuff he will be bringing in. The evening was expertly hosted by our club’s own Michael (who blogs over at Malt & Oak) who is the recently appointed brand ambassador for Douglas Laing.

Aside from all 5 of their regional malts, we got to try:
> 
> * An 8 year old Bunnahabhain from the Provenance range
> 
> * An 8 year old Mortlach from the Provenance range
> 
> * A 12 year old sherry cask Glenrothes from the Old Particular range
> 
> * A special 13 year old release of the Scallywag Speyside regional malt
> 
> * A 21 year old Glen Garioch from the Old Particular range


I took notes for the first three and am kind of disappointed that I didn’t take any for the Glen Garioch as it was the star of the evening in my eyes, but I also just wanted to enjoy myself a little.

better than the IPA, partially owing to the higher ABV and associated body improvement, but also the nice tobacco port note and red fruit complement it well. It's not amazing, and not worth $100 at the LCBO, but a nice dram that I wouldn't turn down a glass of!

Name is Clynelish 24 1990 Adelphi Cask #3232
Review is Time for some whisky geekery and some love for Clynelish which is something I haven’t gotten to do in a while. I’ve mentioned before but Clynelish was the first single malt I ‘discovered’ on my own so I have a bit of a soft spot for it.

Recently (well not so recently, been hanging onto them for a while until I had a totally free weekend) by way of a bottle share I got a hold of these 3 samples. Aside from liking Clynelish I was interested because two are sister casks but with a year difference in age, and the 3rd was the same age as the older two but was distilled a year earlier. Additionally they’re all matured in refill bourbon casks. So I figured I could play around and see the differences when it comes to distillation vs. maturation and all that, and also to drink some Clynelish, because I really like Clynelish.

They all come from Adelphi, an independent bottler named after a closed distillery whose whiskies I have seldom tried because they tend to be on the expensive side, but this is well earned and they have a very solid reputation for putting out some amazing casks.

Review is I had the tremendous pleasure of attending Balvenie's "Master Class" tonight in Dallas. It's a free event for members of their online group "Warehouse 24" (a glorified newsletter).

I was originally under the impression we would only be tasting the core range - the 12 Doublewood, 14 Caribbean, 17 and 21 Portwood. However, Balvenie's ambassador Jonathan Wingo had a lovely surprise for us: he'd decided to pour out the 14 Peat Week, the 30 Year, Tun 1509 (Batch 4!!!), and a 1oz pour of the 40 year (not pictured above).

Needless to say, for a free event, I was ecstatic. This was a better tasting than I had while on the distillery tour in Scotland last month.

Onwards with the whisky!

I’ve been wanting to pop open the Glenfarclas for awhile now and reviewing it gave me a good excuse. And hey, if I’m going to review one sherry aged whisky, why not another? After perusing my open bottles I selected the Glendronach as a nice partner since the ages and strengths are similar even though the Glenfarclas is bottled at cask strength and the Glendronach is reduced. As a final aside, the Glenfarclas doesn’t say what kind of cask it comes from, but after tasting it I’d guess a first-fill European oak oloroso sherry cask.

So I was interested to try it again, this time in the more controlled setting of my dramming room. And as a bonus, I had another G&M Linkwood to try alongside it. Both of these drams came from recent swaps, and I decided it would be fun to do a side-by-each comparison of them. (Just as a side note: if you haven't tried /u/ScotchSwap, what's the matter with you?)

Review is A while ago some of the more well known and influential guys on the alcohol scene here started a Facebook group for enthusiasts here in Israel. Aside from providing a platform for discussion and sharing cool pictures they’ve also been hard at work organizing events and deals for members and so forth. One result of this was a tasting evening in partnership with online retailer Sipil to show the range of Ancnoc and Balblair that they’re starting to bring into the country (more whisky, yay!)

Both are well known highland distilleries with quite serious fan clubs. anCnoc is produced by the Knockdhu disitllery but they use the name of the nearby town as a brand name so as not to cause confusion with the Knockandhu distillery (no relation). Balblair is mostly known for using a vintage system instead of age statements, whichj I personally find annoying as hell because they don’t always list the bottling date so I don’t always know what I’m buying.

The whiskies we tried this evening were:

•	anCnoc 12

•	Balblair 2005 (10 yo)

Name is Smokehead
Review is Hi everyone,

Two mystery malts today from Ian Macleod. They own Glengoyne and Tamdhu distilleries, as well as being independent bottlers for stuff like this.

Smokehead is an Islay single malt, and people love to try and guess which one. There’s only a few viable options but it’s a little more tricky to distinguish than you’d think I think. A reason distilleries will sometimes sell off casks is because they don’t fit the normal profile of the distillery and they can’t use them. So, that means that these could be quite a different style to the normal distillery profile, making it harder to guess. 

Realistically I think there’s only four options: Laphroaig, Ardbeg, Lagavulin and Caol Ila. To get the style of peatiness. I think the clue is the secrecy. They would be able to put Caol Ila on the label if it was Caol Ila. Unless it’s a play to make it seem like one of the others (getting a higher price), while actually being Caol Ila…

I’ve always been very impressed with the Benromach whiskies. They’ve all been hugely consistent in my book, scoring in the mid-high 70’s every time. Recently I’ve been placed at a few events next to them, so I’ve had a chance to try some of their new stuff and I continue to be impressed. Nothing has blown me away yet but the consistently good whisky is a big plus.

I’m also learning it can have some lovely Springbank type notes to it too.

I did also got a chance to try the 35 year old too, but didn’t have time to make notes. Great stuff, but please do it at cask strength you fools!

Name is Aultmore 17 1997 Cadenhead's Small Batch
Review is Hi everyone,

More reviews today, this time from the independent bottler Cadenhead’s. 

I happened to have a stand next to them at The Haig whisky festival in The Netherlands and therefore got the chance to try pretty much everything they had to offer. Which was mostly their Small Batch stuff because the other stuff tends to be single casks.

So, what they do with this range is take a small batch of casks (could be 2 or 5 but rarely more than that) and vat them together. Always from the same vintage too.

Serge is often quoted as saying that a small vatting of casks can be superior to single casks but I tend to disagree. Single casks can be more variable, while vattings tend to be more consistent but more variable can mean superb.

Anyways…

Review is Hi everyone,

More from the Cadenhead’s table today, but these are two interesting whiskies from a little distillery called Strathmill.

I was introduced to the quality of Strathmill quite early after tasting a great sherry cask from Duncan Taylor’s Dimension range, but it isn’t one you see often and definitely isn’t raved about in whisky geek circles as one to try. But it is. One to try that is.

They use [purifiers] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/2017/03/lets-talk-purifiers-water-cooled-non.html) at Strathmill too, although they’re [completely straight] (https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kJmKjywnlis/WNJ0L58-FjI/AAAAAAAABAk/E1Bhx6qAnP87E1Ue64A84p87B7khBqChACLcB/s1600/strathmill%2Bpurifier.JPG) unlike others that are normally S-shaped. That gives you a lighter spirit than most others in Speyside, maybe almost a Lowland style to it.

One of my original 3 UK imports from The Whisky Exchange. Bought this bottle after enjoying my Scotch snob friend's Laddie Classic way too much and watched a Ralfy video on the Laddie 10 2nd Edition. Most definitely hyped it up to the max in my head before drinking it. Does it live up to the hype though?

Review is **Reviews #9-10 - Springbank 10yr (2016) 46% & Longrow 9yr 1st Fill Sauternes Single Cask 58.0%**

You stinkers kept posting glowing reviews of the new Longrow Sauternes cask, and it made it absolutely impossible to not open my bottle. That turned out to be an excellent move. But it did beg a tasting companion. Anticipating how much of a bruiser the Longrow would be, I decided to go with my favorite everyday whisky for a gentler introduction: the Springbank 10yr.

For my next reviews I decided to have some bourbon matured highlanders. The Clynelish was aged in a refill bourbon hogshead. When I first opened it a few months ago it was fairly closed off and too oaky. After letting it sit 2/3 full for over 4 months I’m looking forward to seeing how it’s developed. The Glen Garioch is from a freshly opened bottle, and as you will see, I think I will be setting it aside in the hope it will improve.

A few months ago when I hit Duke status on /r/ScotchSwap (has it really only been a few months?), I hosted a giveaway. And since I wanted to make it something special, I cracked open one of my prized bottles: a 22-year-old Springbank from the Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS); bottle #27.110, to be precise. And although I sent out about half a dozen samples, I resealed it and stuck it back in the whisky cave without tasting it myself.

Name is Glen Scotia 16 2000 Cadenhead's Sherry Cask
Review is Hi everyone,

There’s a distillery I’ve been neglecting to review that is showing a lot of promise recently: Glen Scotia.

This gem has perhaps been overlooked, partly because it hasn’t received much love ownership-wise, partly because it had a variable reputation over the last decade or so. But they seem to be doing a lot better now, with Ralfy and others very much liking the new 15yo.

I’ve had a chance to try two recently, so here they are. First up an official 16yo for the airports and another 16yo single cask from the cask wizards Cadenhead’s.

Review is ): I’m glad I only had a sample of this. Dalmore remains under-whelming for me, and is definitely a try before you buy kind of distillery for me. Perhaps not enough of the sample was left, but I didn’t get much from this pour. I wouldn’t even pay for this. This one was even worse than the Cigar Malt Reserve I tried awhile back. It’s hard to find anything good, but I still wouldn’t mind a freebie of this.

Back in my favourite whisky bar in Chamonix, France *(it’s the only whisky bar in Chamonix, France)* I thought I’d have a crack at that rare 1970 Bruichladdich up on the top shelf. But then I remembered that I brought my wife and she wouldn’t let me blow 50 euros on one shot of whisky. *(it was a double! Come on.)*

So the cheap stuff it was for me. Luckily they had some other really interesting stuff and I ended up trying these Caol Ila’s, only realising afterwards that they were released the same year.

#Bruichladdich Golder Still

This is a one off Bruichladdich distilled in 1984 and aged for 23 years in experimental “dumpy” squat bourbon casks which, I take it, are smaller and so give more wood surface area to volume ratio. Bottled at 51% (which I think is cask strength here).

Name is Torabhaig New Make Spirit
Review is Hi everyone,

Early last year a new distillery started up on the Isle of Skye, Torabhaig. But when you’ve just started a distillery, you don’t have anything to sell yet, so you come up with an alternative to make the money you desperately need to keep the banks at bay. Some sell gin, some sell casks, some sell others whisky and pass it off under their own brand.

These guys have done something a bit different. Become an independent bottler, and prove you know how to select and put whisky together. 

I was lucky enough to meet and be working with Bruce in the sweatbox of Limburg Whisky Fair, who had some of their stuff. Funny story: on the Mossburn box, it states that the master distiller is ‘Robert Haig,’ but there is no Robert Haig. When the guy was painting Torabhaig on the distillery front, he split it into To-Rab-Haig, and thus a hilarious in-joke was born! Pretty ballsy to put that on your packaging though, fairplay to ‘em!

Four whiskies today, all from the recently repackaged range Carn Mor from Morrison & Mackay. I quite liked the old packaging too, with the sideways labels that you couldn’t really read but oh well. I’ve tried a few of these now and they are always very good-great with the standout being the [Chariman’s Legacy Bowmore] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/2018/04/bowmore-bicentenary-very-special-review.html).

These samples were very generously poured for me by all round legend Graeme Mackay at Limburg whisky fair.

This is more adventurous than the A.D. Rattray for sure, but not half so much as the 11 year SV Ledaig I had a while back (this is also far better than that one was). That bbq potato chip thing is an original. That said, I prefer the A.D. Rattray. I'm probably in a small minority here but based on my small sample size so far (more than just these two, but still small), I think I prefer ex-bourbon Ledaig to ex-sherry in general.

Review is Hi everyone,

On a stag do near Rome we knocked on the door and it was opened only a split second later by hipster-type barmen, welcoming us into their prohibition bar. We missed the real entrance, located in a cupboard inside a Chinese restaurant. 

In a surreal, slightly alcohol blurred, version of vision I assessed the range of whiskies behind the bar and found myself impressed. Independent bottlings. Cask strength stuff. Bottles with weird circus stuff on the front. This was clearly a quality establishment. I glanced to the left and found a range of Mezcal too, recommending one to the groom with the bartender’s choice of cocktail. 

Finding myself drinkless I ask the barmen to move everything aside so I can have a look at the bottle at the very back. I’ll have a single I say.

I won a bottle at auction for not much more than retail.  And it arrived at around the same time as I got a sample of batch 60 from an [online retailer](www.whiskysite.nl).  I had a bit of my batch 61 left to compare against, which is my least favorite batch so far.  So hopefully they are both better than that.  Batch 49 ABV = 60.1% and Batch 60 ABV = 60.3%.  Batch 49 is a shade or two darker than batch 60.  Non chill-filtered and no added color.

Name is Singleton of Dufftown 12
Review is Hi everyone,

I only realised the other day, when looking through the sidebar on my blog, that I haven’t reviewed a whisky from Dufftown distillery yet, which is crazy because my first bottle of single malt whisky I bought was Singleton of Dufftown 12.

Its never been a particularly impressive or well regarded distillery though and the attempts of Diageo to make something of it as a single malt seem to have fallen a little flat. They tried age statements, then they tried no age statements with cool names and now they have a new one that just sounds the same as everything else on the market. I’ve tried three from these different eras.

Name is Compass Box Peat Monster
Review is I picked up a nice little sampler of the core range of blends from Compass Box Whisky Co. I’ve been following John Glaser and his work over at Compass Box ever since around 2015, when they started butting heads with the Scotch Whisky Association in their campaign for greater label transparency. I support that effort, and find a lot to like in the ethos of Compass Box and the innovations they represent for the industry.

A few years back, Bacardi Limited purchased a minority stake in the company. This definitely follows a pattern of established industry veterans buying out disruptive startups. But so far, Compass Box seems to be plodding along in the same direction (if perhaps now with better distribution). I’ll be following along in the years to come.

On to the tasting.

Review is ;

These are the brands of malt whisky that Loch Lomond distillery produce from various stills and various peating levels. Is it confusing? Yes. Is it interesting? Yes, I think so anyway. 

As far as I am aware, both of these are heavily peated whiskies coming from the distillery but using the different still systems to give slightly different flavours. The Inchmoan uses the stills with rectifying plates in and the Croftengea doesn’t? Perhaps? But there’s isn’t really much info online, hopefully we can clear this all up when I’m at the distillery in November. In the meantime what are these two like?

The 5th edition of Flaming Heart is one of my favourite Compass Box’s and I just love the packaging. Might be one of my favourite packagings on any Scotch actually. Not too overblown, lovely shaded bottle. So I was very curious to see how this new version stacks up.

For reasons explained [here] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/2017/08/lets-talk-partial-triple-distillation.html), Mortlach is awesome. A brand not without its up and downs though, having been a great (perhaps the best) Flora & Fauna, discontinued into a 50cl ultra premium (read expensive) range and now the backtrack!

Diageo actually listened. LISTENED! To us! The multitude. About a whisky. Amazing.

Anyway, since their ultra premium stuff didn’t sell very well, they’ve brought back the 16 with a vengeance. I got a chance to try it yesterday and realised I’ve got a whole flight of Mortlach’s I’ve tried recently, including the F&F. So we’ve got quite the selection today.

Name is GlenDronach 18 Allardice
Review is 
**Introductory Comments**:  Today I'll be reviewing the heart of the GlenDronach lineup, the Original 12, Revival 15, and Allardice 18.  Before I get into it, I'm going to touch briefly on GlenDronach's recent history, namely their brief closure and differences in production before and after the closure.  I know that many of the veterans here already know this stuff, but there always seems to be someone who isn't familiar with it when a GlenDronach review is posted, so I figured I would rehash it.  After my discussion, I'll review the 18, 15, and 12, with brief comments for each, followed by a summarizing comparison of all three.

An important thing to keep in mind when you look at a bottling of GlenDronach is that the distillery was closed from 1996 until May 2002.  This means that depending on the bottling date of the bottle that you get, the whisky may have been matured for significantly longer than the age statement indicates.  But for all of the GlenDronach expressions with stated ages, there will come a point where the age statement subtracted from the bottling date falls *after* the distillery was re-opened in 2002, which means that nominally identical bottles that were bottled before and after this point could differ in the actual age of the matured whisky by up to six years (this [Words of Whisky post](https://wordsofwhisky.com/glendronach-is-a-lot-older-than-the-label-says/) on the topic includes a nice chart to help you visualize this).  In theory, this means that the "pre-mothball" bottlings of the Original 12 and the Revival 15 should be more mature and exhibit a richer, sherried character than the "post-mothball" bottlings. 

Of course, the story is a bit more nuanced than that.  First, the quality of sherry-seasoned casks is just as important as the maturation time.  Even though reviewers consistently rate the pre-mothball Original 12 and Revival 15 higher than the post-mothball versions, it's possible that the older releases also spent time in more active sherry casks, in addition to simply spending more time in sherry casks.  We may be seeing evidence of this with the Allardice 18, which despite still containing pre-mothball distillate, has had some less than flattering appraisals for the recent 2018 bottlings:  For examples, see this [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ab3qqm/review_30_1982_inchgower_33yr_jack_wieber_546/) by /u/playingwithfire and [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/a8mqxk/review_50_glendronach_18_year_allardice/) by /u/bpnelson7.

The second difference between the pre- and post-mothball bottlings is the distillate itself.  Prior to the closure, GlenDronach did their own floor maltings and directly fired their stills, but after the closure, they stopped using their own malting floor and in September 2005 they switched to indirect firing.  Although a brand ambassador recently told us in a [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/883vbm/hi_rscotch_im_the_brand_ambassador_of_benriach/) that the distillery attempts to simulate the effects of direct firing (hat tip to /u/forswearThinPotation for asking this question back then):

> In layman's terms, we have made a mechanism that recreates the "hot spots" that you would have on a still that is directly heated. The whisky is pumped through this machine and then reintroduced into the stills.

The distillery used lightly peated malt prior to the closure, but according to [scotchwhisky.com](https://scotchwhisky.com/whiskypedia/1853/glendronach/#/) and Charlie MacLean's [Whiskypedia](https://www.amazon.com/Whiskypedia-Compendium-Scotch-Charles-MacLean/dp/1510702881), they are still using lightly peated malt.  But of course, it's possible that the exact ppm has changed.

When you add all of this up, there's a lot of variables at play and it's hard to make the blanket statement that pre-mothball is guaranteed to be great and post-mothball is guaranteed to be not so great.  But when you look at the reviews over the years for the Original 12 and Revival 15, that certainly seems to be the consensus opinion.  It will be interesting, and potentially disappointing, to see if the Allardice 18 follows the same trend over the course of the next year.

But for all of the GlenDronach expressions with stated ages, there will come a point where the age statement subtracted from the bottling date falls *after* the distillery was re-opened in 2002, which means that nominally identical bottles that were bottled before and after this point could differ in the actual age of the matured whisky by up to six years (this [Words of Whisky post](https://wordsofwhisky.com/glendronach-is-a-lot-older-than-the-label-says/) on the topic includes a nice chart to help you visualize this).  In theory, this means that the "pre-mothball" bottlings of the Original 12 and the Revival 15 should be more mature and exhibit a richer, sherried character than the "post-mothball" bottlings. 

Of course, the story is a bit more nuanced than that.  First, the quality of sherry-seasoned casks is just as important as the maturation time.  Even though reviewers consistently rate the pre-mothball Original 12 and Revival 15 higher than the post-mothball versions, it's possible that the older releases also spent time in more active sherry casks, in addition to simply spending more time in sherry casks.  We may be seeing evidence of this with the Allardice 18, which despite still containing pre-mothball distillate, has had some less than flattering appraisals for the recent 2018 bottlings:  For examples, see this [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ab3qqm/review_30_1982_inchgower_33yr_jack_wieber_546/) by /u/playingwithfire and [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/a8mqxk/review_50_glendronach_18_year_allardice/) by /u/bpnelson7.

The second difference between the pre- and post-mothball bottlings is the distillate itself.  Prior to the closure, GlenDronach did their own floor maltings and directly fired their stills, but after the closure, they stopped using their own malting floor and in September 2005 they switched to indirect firing.  Although a brand ambassador recently told us in a [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/883vbm/hi_rscotch_im_the_brand_ambassador_of_benriach/) that the distillery attempts to simulate the effects of direct firing (hat tip to /u/forswearThinPotation for asking this question back then):

> In layman's terms, we have made a mechanism that recreates the "hot spots" that you would have on a still that is directly heated. The whisky is pumped through this machine and then reintroduced into the stills.

The distillery used lightly peated malt prior to the closure, but according to [scotchwhisky.com](https://scotchwhisky.com/whiskypedia/1853/glendronach/#/) and Charlie MacLean's [Whiskypedia](https://www.amazon.com/Whiskypedia-Compendium-Scotch-Charles-MacLean/dp/1510702881), they are still using lightly peated malt.  But of course, it's possible that the exact ppm has changed.

When you add all of this up, there's a lot of variables at play and it's hard to make the blanket statement that pre-mothball is guaranteed to be great and post-mothball is guaranteed to be not so great.  But when you look at the reviews over the years for the Original 12 and Revival 15, that certainly seems to be the consensus opinion.  It will be interesting, and potentially disappointing, to see if the Allardice 18 follows the same trend over the course of the next year.

Name is GlenDronach 12 Original
Review is 
**Introductory Comments**:  Today I'll be reviewing the heart of the GlenDronach lineup, the Original 12, Revival 15, and Allardice 18.  Before I get into it, I'm going to touch briefly on GlenDronach's recent history, namely their brief closure and differences in production before and after the closure.  I know that many of the veterans here already know this stuff, but there always seems to be someone who isn't familiar with it when a GlenDronach review is posted, so I figured I would rehash it.  After my discussion, I'll review the 18, 15, and 12, with brief comments for each, followed by a summarizing comparison of all three.

An important thing to keep in mind when you look at a bottling of GlenDronach is that the distillery was closed from 1996 until May 2002.

Name is Glentauchers 15 2003 Chieftain's
Review is **Introductory Comments**: Today I'll be reviewing two different single sherry cask independent bottlings, one being a 10-year-old Edradour bottled by their parent company Signatory Vintage as part of their well-regarded Un-Chillfiltered Collection, and the other being a 15-year-old Glentauchers bottled as part of Ian Macleod's Chieftain's line.  Both of them are bottled at 46% ABV without artificial coloring and without chill filtration.  Despite neither of them explicitly saying so on the label, they were both probably matured in Oloroso casks.  We know this because Signatory frequently bottles 10yo Edradour single casks for their UCF collection which they describe on their [online shop](https://edradour.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&path=67_69&product_id=60) as being Oloroso casks, while a representative from Ian Macleod confirmed to me that this particular Glentauchers bottling was also an Oloroso cask.

I thought that posting a side-by-side review of these two bottlings would be fun because they turned out to be a great example of how different sherry-matured malts can have significantly different flavor profiles.  While both of these bottles are similar in some ways, their overall styles are quite different, which I hope to convey in my tasting notes.

Ardmore is awesome stuff and we just selected one for one of the r/scotch bottlings. But these two casks I have been very interested in because they are quite unusual. A white wine hogshead and a sherry Gorda. White wine casks are very rarely used for whisky and these SMWS bottlings have been some of the few. The sherry Gordas, on the other hand, have become a little legendary for their huge sulphury and strange flavours.

Review is **Scotch Review #94-97: Scotch Whisky Experience (Glenkinchie 12, Raasay While We Wait, BenRiach Heart of Speyside, Port Charlotte 10)**

As part of our grand European adventure earlier this month, we stopped in Edinburgh. Both of us completely agree that Edinburgh was our favorite place on our journey (we also visited London, Paris, Prague, and Manchester) and it’s already gone on our list of places to go back to. The city was beautiful and driving through the countryside was absolutely breath taking. 

While we were there, we stopped at the Scotch Whisky Experience next to Edinburgh Castle (how nice of them to put it right where [this walking tour started](https://www.frommers.com/destinations/edinburgh/walking-tours/walking-tour-1)) to do the tour. The tour consisted of three parts: the first part was a pretty cheesy barrel ride that I really could’ve done without it, the second part was a quick introduction to the regions of Scotch whisky and a tasting of something from one of the regions (I got a Tullibardine Soverign, wife got Glenfarclas 10), and the third part was a walk through their famous whisky collection. After the tour, we got a flight of drams which I’ve reviewed below.

Overall, while I enjoyed the tour, I can’t help but feel that this is a massive tourist trap you might be better off avoiding. The tour without a tasting flight at the end is £16, and I wouldn’t do it for that price. With a flight, it’s £28 so not as bad if you think of it as getting 5 drams, but still spendy. The store attached to this place has a really nice selection though and the prices aren’t that crazy (plus a tour ticket does give you a discount at the shop).

Not included in this review are the Tullibardine Soverign (which was awful, would rate it in the 60s easily) and the Glenfarclas 10 (which I’ve reviewed previously [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/8nmaup/review_22_glenfarclas_10_year/)).

Not included in this review are the Tullibardine Soverign (which was awful, would rate it in the 60s easily) and the Glenfarclas 10 (which I’ve reviewed previously [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/8nmaup/review_22_glenfarclas_10_year/)).

Name is Glenkinchie 12
Review is **Scotch Review #94-97: Scotch Whisky Experience (Glenkinchie 12, Raasay While We Wait, BenRiach Heart of Speyside, Port Charlotte 10)**

As part of our grand European adventure earlier this month, we stopped in Edinburgh. Both of us completely agree that Edinburgh was our favorite place on our journey (we also visited London, Paris, Prague, and Manchester) and it’s already gone on our list of places to go back to. The city was beautiful and driving through the countryside was absolutely breath taking. 

While we were there, we stopped at the Scotch Whisky Experience next to Edinburgh Castle (how nice of them to put it right where [this walking tour started](https://www.frommers.com/destinations/edinburgh/walking-tours/walking-tour-1)) to do the tour. The tour consisted of three parts: the first part was a pretty cheesy barrel ride that I really could’ve done without it, the second part was a quick introduction to the regions of Scotch whisky and a tasting of something from one of the regions (I got a Tullibardine Soverign, wife got Glenfarclas 10), and the third part was a walk through their famous whisky collection. After the tour, we got a flight of drams which I’ve reviewed below.

Overall, while I enjoyed the tour, I can’t help but feel that this is a massive tourist trap you might be better off avoiding. The tour without a tasting flight at the end is £16, and I wouldn’t do it for that price. With a flight, it’s £28 so not as bad if you think of it as getting 5 drams, but still spendy.

Kilkerran proved to be one of my new favourites when it first appeared a few years ago now. The 12 and 8yo cask strength really impressed me, while a rum cask sample I got to try (that I assume is still in a cask somewhere) was incredible. The future looked bright…

To celebrate their 15th anniversary, Kilkerran decided to release a load of single casks, all 15 years old to different markets. Other 15 year olds have started appearing in other special editions and have received mixed reviews.

The distillery is not only small, but is barely running at all. I believe they were running 3 months of the year—then it was reduced even further.

Anyway, here’s some new ones.

What better way to go into 800 Scotch reviews than Bowmore, the supremely hateable distillery that made some of the best whiskies ever created, then some of the worst and now some of the most mediocre.

The 80’s was a hard time for Bowmore, made worse by the denial of an obvious problem. But thankfully they managed to make some better whiskies into the 90’s.

The problem was dubbed ‘French Whore Perfume’ or FWP by one creative whisky blogger and the name has stuck.

Today I’ve got three from the 80’s and early 90’s.

Review is Hi everyone,

Do we love Ardmore? Yes, we do.

Why, I hear you ask? Because its good whisky young, its good old. Its peaty and smoky and savoury and buttery and fishy and fruity and everything else you could want from a peaty highlander. Yes, I’m a little biased because I own a barrel of the stuff…

Anywho, these are two expressions that I tried recently, both independent bottlings and both slightly older bottlings. Both pretty expensive but both very good.

What is interesting with the comparison between these two is that the 1996 would have been distilled using [direct fired stills] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/2017/07/lets-talk-direct-fired-stills-discussion.html), while the 2002 is from steam heated stills (Ardmore converted in 2001).

Review is Hi everyone,

Two Caol Ila’s from my birth year today! There’s always something special about tasting whisky from the same year as you were born, I have no idea why, it just seems to be the case.

But it gets harder and harder as you go on and, in fact, both of these bottlings were bottled a little while ago.

I can’t repeated enough that Caol Ila, when on form, can be just as good as any other Islay whisky and can often have recognisable elements of Laphroaig, Ardbeg or Lagavulin to it. It’s incredibly versatile.

Both distilleries (much like Ledaig) produced feinty, weird and sometimes horrible whiskies that people found hard to get along with but are entering a new dawn with cool experimentation, special but affordable releases that seem to be, as yet, untouched by too much marketing bullshit and… um, Macallan-ing.

I’ve got more Glen Scotia coming up with my build up to 1000 reviews but we will leave them for now.

Glenlivet, much like Glenfiddich, holds a special place in memory for me. The 12-year was one of the first whiskies I’ve ever had and for the longest time I couldn’t keep it and Glenfiddich straight. I’ve not had a lot of Glenlivet lately so I’m really curious to see how this has held up over time.

Name is Miltonduff 17 1999 Single Malts of Scotland
Review is **Introductory Comments**:  For my next handful of reviews, I'll be focusing on independently bottled single malts aged in refill casks, from distilleries whose output is primarily targeted for mass market blends.  It is the view of many a whisky purist that single malts aged for a long time time in refill wood represent the best that scotch can be, but the catch is that the distillate has to have "*character*" in order to mature into something compelling.  With so many distilleries these days using materials and production practices that emphasize high throughput and consistency of profile, it can be challenging to find truly impressive whiskies that aren't relying on heavy peat and/or assertive wood.

Today I'll be looking at a pair of unpeated Speyside single malts from the Macduff and Miltonduff distilleries.  Macduff is owned by Bacardi, with some of its output being bottled as single malt under the Glen Deveron name, while Miltonduff is owned by Pernod Ricard and is used in the Ballantine's blends, with very little in the way of official single malt bottlings.  Macduff is one of the younger distilleries in Scotland, having been built in the [1960's](https://www.malt-whisky-madness.com/maltmadness/whisky/macduff.html), while Miltonduff was built in [1824](https://www.malt-whisky-madness.com/maltmadness/whisky/miltonduff.html), when the modern era of scotch whisky began.  Macduff has an uneven number of stills, which is rare in the industry since usually you'll have a wash still paired with a spirit still; Macduff has five stills (two wash and three spirit), an odd number shared only by Talisker.  Miltonduff used to be triple distilled, and from 1964 to 1981 a set of Lomond stills were in operation that were used to produce single malt under the Mosstowie brand.  Despite the age difference and respective idiosyncrasies, there isn't much else that jumps out as especially salient or unmodern/old school about their production practices.

Review is **Introductory Comments**:  At the end of 2018, I reviewed [Glenlivet 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/a6qbqd/review_44_glenlivet_12/), and my tasting notes and impressions were probably exactly what you think they would be.  But in 2019, Glenlivet [revamped](https://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/latest-news/25760/the-glenlivet-is-given-bold-redesign/) the packaging of their core lineup, including somewhat of a name change for the entry-level 12 year expression, which now emphasizes "Double Oak" on the labeling.  Nominally this is supposed to be just a superficial change, as the [pre-revamp tasting notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20181019104640/https://www.theglenlivet.com/en-us/the-collection/12-year-old) and the [current tasting notes](https://www.theglenlivet.com/en-US/the-collection/12-year-old) are very similar.  The only difference is that now the casks are described as American and European, instead of American and "traditional."  In any event, I'm going to review this newer version along with a suitable sparring partner:  Tomatin 12, another 12-year-old entry-level malt that is also aged in two different types of casks, ex-bourbon and sherry.

Review is Hi everyone,

Got a few Arran’s for you today! Gotta say, I love the new packaging and range. The new bottles have a great look and feel, though of course its the juice that we’re really interested in. Plenty of the new stuff seems darker, with more sherry casks in the mix of the usual age statement range.

Having started in 1995, it is now Arran’s 25th Anniversary, which should bring some exciting things as well.

If memory serves, my first experience of Arran was the 12yo cask strength, which I found very solid but isn’t around anymore. Since then I’ve always found Arran to be very dependable quality malt.

Two 16 year old Laphroaig’s to review today.

I was excited for the new OB as it’s a decent age, decent strength and Laphroaig. The only thing that grates me slightly is that I paid £20 less for the 18yo, but that was a few years ago now and such is life.

And since we seem to be in the middle of a little apocalypse I opened a 16yo Laphroaig from SMWS that we can compare against.

Another duo today! This time it’s Springbank’s turn.

It has taken me far too long to get round to trying the 18yo. I can get pretty expensive and although I’d heard that it was great, I didn’t want to risk forking out on a bottle. So I waited patiently but just never got round to it or saw it many places.

I also recently tried a official single cask for the USA.

I had a Lagavulin 12 at a bar years ago and it was just nothing like what I’d had before.  Based on the timing of when I had it, I assume it was the 2015 release, which I tracked down a bottle of.  I decided to do this one side by side with the release from the following year, which was branded as a 200th anniversary edition.  I’d only had that one glass before so have no experience with how the batches differed, and since this is a cask strength release and not quite so standard as the 8 year old, I’m expecting a bit of difference if nothing else due to the slight difference in ABV.

Honestly, I'm surprised by the 12. I didn't think it would be good at all but it's actually fairly reasonable. It's not my cup of tea at all, but I can see why people like it and why it's been a staple of the scotch world for decades. This 15yr Signatory though is just bad. And I'm, again, honestly surprised. This is going down as the first bad Signatory I've had, believe it or not.

* Single Malt and Grain Scotch Whiskies

* 5 samples, 1oz each

* Partial blind tasting



This was a virtual partially blind tasting I was invited to through a local group I was fortunate to join; one of the highlights of this terrible year in general. I say partially blind because while the samples themselves were not labeled outside of a number, I was aware of the distilleries and ages of these 6 samples when signing up for the tasting. So it was more of a fun addition to the tasting being able to try and guess which was which. 


I’ve seen a lot of DramFool bottles recently through various boards, forums, and social media. If you aren't familiar with the name, DramFool is another up and coming Independent Bottler based out of the UK. This tasting was hosted by the owner and founder, Bruce Farquhar. Unfortunately, I signed on a bit late and missed the first sample but was able to participate in the other 5. I’ll review that 1st sample on its own at a later date. 


I’m trying not to let the awesome experience of this tasting influence my opinions of these drams but I have to admit, this was such a fun and informative event full of great drams and folks, that I can’t guarantee fully unbiased opinions. Many thanks to Bruce for hosting this tasting at 1AM his local time, and Mario and all the others for assisting in setting this up!

* Partial blind tasting



This was a virtual partially blind tasting I was invited to through a local group I was fortunate to join; one of the highlights of this terrible year in general. I say partially blind because while the samples themselves were not labeled outside of a number, I was aware of the distilleries and ages of these 6 samples when signing up for the tasting. So it was more of a fun addition to the tasting being able to try and guess which was which. 


I’ve seen a lot of DramFool bottles recently through various boards, forums, and social media.

The 2005 SC is an average dram that's all about the port.

Review is Tonight I'll be comparing a few Fettercairn independent bottlings.  I've had a soft spot for Fettercairn since a gentleman at Cadenhead's introduced me to them a few years ago.  It was a 1988 28 year and I loved it so much I ended up going through a few bottles.  Nice to find a whisky that is under the radar and relatively inexpensive and doesn't sell out quickly.  But that one is long gone and I'd love to find a nice replacement for it.  So let's see if any of these will fit the bill.

This tasting of 5 drams was part of a monthly meeting with a local group of enthusiasts. All samples were 1oz and the drams in question, and order, are:


* McDonald’s Pure Malt 185th Anniversary @46%

* Craigellachie 17y @46%

* Glen Scotia 13y - SMWS 93.114 @59%

* Arran Music Festival 2015 @59%

* Hazelburn 14y Oloroso Matured @49.3%


Given the back to back nature of this tasting I’m just going to rate these generally on a 1-10 scale,  as opposed to my slightly more subjective and typical 1-100 scale. Also, given the 1 oz sample size this really is just a quick acquaintance with these whiskies so take that as you will

Easy ordering, the Recioto is a clear cut above the other two. I'm not a big fan of the Carnoustie honestly. It's a fine dram, sure, but it's far too sweet for me, and very simple. 

The Recioto vs. Br6 is a little closer, but I do dig the darker fruit character to the Recioto. That floral note that develops over time with the Br6 is excellent though.

I have not had a proper indie bottling on Old Pulteney in a while, much less one over 20 years old and from the 1970s to boot! I've always been impressed by most things I've had from this distillery at 15+ years old so let's hope this one starts this lineup strong!

Review is This past weekend I took a long overdue trip to New York City. The impetus was mostly cocktail and food driven as I didn't really expect to find a lot of interesting whiskey in the city. Sure enough even at the best whiskey bars NYC supposedly had to offer the unique bourbon pickings were slim. I did get a chance to checkout a few interesting bottles though so I thought I would share my notes. In general I don't usually like to review a whiskey until I am at least 50% through a bottle so these are more first impressions than anything.

I'm a big Four Roses fan for sure. eventually i'll have to do what TOModera did and get all 10 recipes to compare. glad I've got a bottle of this on the shelf and i'll be savouring it for a long time as i'll never have a chance to try it again. really sad Four Roses has decided to exit the Canadian market. maybe once the bourbon boom dies down in a decade i'll have a chance to try more of their stuff. 

please give me a tartan and for my flair please put Four Roses 125th.

**In summation** - Surprising differently profiles for what I suspected to be fairly similar bourbons.

Is the BIB worth $3 more in a heads-up race to me... yes, probably.

Name is Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition 2015
Review is Ok so I meant for this to be a brief side by side and not a full review as I would normally write.  Thanks to /u/Anagama for the '15 sample.  I won't be giving a score for two reasons.  One, I own a bottle of the 2015 and I don't know if I could be as accurate in scoring as I would hope.  Two, these are both fantastic pours and I would rather people know their own preferences than think that the quality of one was somehow significantly less than the other, I'll go ahead and tell you that they are not.

Name is Jefferson's Ocean 3
Review is I got three mystery samples from /u/themoosehasarrived recently, and the suspense has been killing me so I figured I'd review these bad boys and see what he sent me. 

Random aside, since that's all the rage in review intros these days: I was discussing the review process with some friends recently and it's really interesting how different everyone's methods are. 

Some people try to review everything blind, some find that the knowledge that you're drinking something special is a part of the experience. There are people who want multiple sittings with a full bottle before they share their notes, others find a single ounce to be more than enough for a review. 

I was even surprised to hear a friend doesn't ever listen to anything while reviewing. I'm the sort that enjoys having whisky review music on. For this trio of mystery reviews, I've got a new album that I've been digging on the stereo: The Highest of Dystopia by Serenity in Murder. If you're into melodic death metal sort of stuff like Dark Tranquility, pull up the [full album stream](https://youtu.be/JyLh44ovFcE) on YouTube and give it a listen (I bet it makes for good whisky review *reading* music too). There are two aspects of the band's personnel that I found greatly surprising. 

Enough about music, onto the whisky!

Name is Willett Family Estate Bourbon 22y
Review is Over the last year my collection of whiskey samples has [grown out of control](http://i.imgur.com/dDf1IMb.jpg). It was never intentional but almost every time someone asked me if I had tried something and I answered no then somehow I ended up with a sample of it. Let's just say there are some really generous people in the whiskey enthusiast circles. With the rest of the year off, I've got plenty of free time so I've decided to make a year end push to clear out as many as I can.

Up tonight are two samples of famed Willett Family Estate C barrels. Willett C barrels are mostly gift shop only releases that are aged from 18-22 years, bottled at cask strength, and are said to be wheated bourbons distilled at the old Bernheim distillery in 1993. Good luck finding any of these as each release has sold out in hours or less even at the hefty price tag of around $300 or more a bottle. The secondary value on these is even worse at a sickening $550 or more which is beyond stupid but I digress.

In my own collection I also happen to have two different cask strength wheated bourbons from Buffalo Trace in the form of William Larue Weller. Those bottles are also very limited, impossible to find on any shelf these days, and hovering around the same sickening secondary market value. Given the extreme craze for all of these releases I thought it would be fun to compare them all in a blind side by side. Here are my blind results from worst to first and then some thoughts on the whole group.

Name is Old Weller Antique 107 Red Dog
Review is As I mentioned in my previous posts, I've got [huge backlog of samples](http://i.imgur.com/dDf1IMb.jpg) that I am trying to work through before the end of the year. In that stockpile were a couple of different single barrel store selections of Old Weller Antique. I've got a few different selections of Old Weller Antique in my bunker as well and since I've never officially reviewed any of them before I thought it would make a fun shootout. 

I should preface this shootout with the fact that I am big fan of Old Weller Antique and so is my local whiskey group. At one point we had to ban it from our blind tastings because every time it was submitted it crushed the competition. For me, Old Weller Antique has a extremely distinctive sweet and spicy cinnamon profile that when combined with its decent age and great proof make it an attractive combo especially given the low retail price.

Review is about a week ago now, a bunch of the guys from /r/canadawhisky got together for a high proof bourbon tasting that's been in the works for a few months. We finally found a day that worked for everyone and trekked up to /u/Devoz's house for the event. 

right up front, big thank you to /u/texacer for helping us pick out the bourbons to try. all of us sent lists of bourbons we had that were 90 proof or higher, and Tex picked which ones we should bring. this kept it completely blind RE: what bourbons were in the mix. we brought them in sample bottles, and huge thanks to /u/Devoz's wife who graciously helped us by pouring them in a random order, half oz pours each. we would then jot down some notes and make a 100% blind guess. once all bourbons were done, the list was revealed and we re-guessed, after which each person scored up their correct answers. going in, we all expected to do terribly, and put the over/under on total correct round 1 guesses at 4 out of 63. I personally assumed I'd get none right. 

participants were /u/boy86 /u/devoz /u/tomodera /u/slackerdude /u/lasidar /u/jolarbear myself, and /u/devoz's wife. AND special thanks to /u/Kinohead who couldn't make it last minute but sent a sample anyway, and /u/neversafeforlife for sending a mystery sample in the mail to make the night even drunker!

Review is Thanks to a great community at /r/scotchswap and /r/whiskonsin - I've procured bottles and samples of all 5 of Buffalo Trace's Stagg Jr. Barrel Proof bourbon releases. I, in typical weekend fashion, will be trying all 5 and comparing them to one another while also rating them. I'm thrilled. In an effort to make this a little scientific, I've done some things for science. 

A bit of background:

5 Identical Glasses. All rested for 20 minutes. I'm conducting this experiment in 3 stages, each with about a half an ounce, 1 hour apart. This is to ensure that intoxication doesn't cloud my judgment and to compare how some bourbons open up with lots of air over time. Now, I don't like science to mix with my alcohol too too much so that's about it. After the end, I'll post and then enjoy the rest of the samples. Sunday Funday, amirite. 

Stagg Jr. is aged for "nearly a decade" unlike it's magnum father BTAC George T Stagg. Releases so far have been just about 6 months apart and their availability varies wildly, at least here in the Midwest.

A bit of background:

5 Identical Glasses. All rested for 20 minutes. I'm conducting this experiment in 3 stages, each with about a half an ounce, 1 hour apart. This is to ensure that intoxication doesn't cloud my judgment and to compare how some bourbons open up with lots of air over time. Now, I don't like science to mix with my alcohol too too much so that's about it. After the end, I'll post and then enjoy the rest of the samples. Sunday Funday, amirite. 

Stagg Jr. is aged for "nearly a decade" unlike it's magnum father BTAC George T Stagg. Releases so far have been just about 6 months apart and their availability varies wildly, at least here in the Midwest.

Name is Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye 8 
Review is I was lucky enough to have the amazing opportunity to travel to the Smooth Ambler Distillery a few weeks ago with a group of excellent chaps to pick out a barrel of their Old Scout bourbon. Turns out, we ended up with two. Be sure to check out /u/rickhouse_funk's write-up for details of our trip and what the barrel picking entailed. 

Naturally, I needed a souvenir to bring home from the Smooth Ambler gift shop, and since I'm a sucker for unnecessary glassware I got myself another pair of glencairns. What better way to christen them than with two pours of some Smooth Ambler Rye?

Better yet, these samples come from two of my compatriots from the barrel picking trip, /u/jmmdc and /u/Looney_Bin. Smooth Ambler Barrel Proof Ryes are suddenly rather difficult to find and it's unlikely to change anytime soon, so these are some drams to savor.

Hey there r/bourbon!     
So it's general knowledge that you need more Four Roses in your life. Yes, you too. Hence /u/slanderousu – more recently known as Slandy among these parts – send me some. And (supposedly so) amazing ones. As well as a mystery which he insists is a real thing. I have a strong feeling it's not but I'll find out tonight. Anyway, in preparation for the awesome 4R /u/mysteriousu sent, two other also super awesome swappers /u/ChipButtyPhysicist and /u/ernestreviews used their visionary power to support me with two samples of the Four Roses Single Barrel (one labeled 37-3B and one TS 41-21).      
Now, why am I telling you all this? One because I like to jabber, but more importantly two: I don't know much about Bourbon. Yes, I read some books. Slanderousu reminds me of the Four Roses website and their table on the “secret” behind the OxSx code every time I talk about FR. But, strangely enough, I tend to forget my Bourbon facts rather quickly. This is important for the rest of the review because I first thought that since the Four Roses Single Barrel was the supermarket bottle which more often then not stands beside the FR Yellow Label (at least here in Germany), it is just named Single Barrel but is not really a single barrel bottling. But then the different codes (TS 41-2I and 37-3B) made me think differently but the abv (50%) and the low price made me turn to it just being a name again. I was confused at that point and though nah, forget it ~~yo home to Bel Air~~ and just drunk it and, well, here is that:

Name is Old Weller Antique 107
Review is **Whisky Network Reviews #49-51**

I've been busy doing reviews in the /r/WorldWhisky forum, and figured it was about time I ventured into this Bourbon enclave.  And what better place to start than with everyone's favourite "poor man's Pappy", the entry-level Wellers.


As everyone knows, the Weller and Van Winkle brands share the same basic DNA - they are produced by the same distiller, share the same wheated mashbill, are aged in the same manner in the same warehouses, and are diluted to the same final proof.  In the case of Weller 12/Van Winkle 12 Lot B, they are even aged the same amount of time (Old Weller Antique 107 is at least a few years younger than Old Rip Van Winkle 10).  So the difference really comes down to barrel selection * - the premium barrels from the best parts of the warehouse get blended into the Van Winkles each year, and the rest becomes Weller.  (* = *edit: I'm thinking of the Weller 12/Van Winkle 12 comparison here, specifically*).


For this review, I have both the 53.5% ABV Old Weller Antique (purchased at the LCBO for $35 CAD) and the 45% ABV W.L. Weller 12 year old (generously supplied by /u/Lasidar).  As is popular in some circles, I have also made up a blend of 60:40 OWA:Weller 12 (left to marry for several weeks before tasting).   Since Lasidar was particularly generous with a 4oz pour of Weller 12, I saved some of for future comparisons, and consigned the rest to the blend.

I always feel slightly awkward here. American whiskey isn't really my thing. Don't even get me started on the acronyms. Even after tasting 500 whiskies, only just over 20 are Bourbons. 

I feel shame in my heart for this. But really, you find you don't care for something, you avoid it.

Well, until you think that 'this time it'll be different.' I'll try some rye, I'll try something older, I'll try something expensive or rare or or or.

So at the whisky show, I spotted some Bourbons that everyone raves about, goes mental over and sell out in about 1/2 a second here in the UK. And thought 'this time it'll be different.' And it was, sort of.

Review is Hi guys,

I was standing in The Whisky Exchange’s new shop in Covent Garden, London, when I noticed a Brand Ambassador standing by a small stand with some whiskey on. What whiskey? Westland Single Malt American Whiskey. 

That intrigued me. Firstly, because I love single malt Scotch and drink/review a lot of it. 

Second, because I don’t normally drink that much Bourbon or American whiskey in general. 

This seemed like a good go between and something different. Worth giving a try, albeit from little plastic cups. Accordingly, the reviews are quite limited.

Well a big lightning bolt struck my house and fried all my electronics so whiskey reviews, along with all modern conveniences had to take a pretty substantial hiatus.  However, I am back and with perseverance unmatched by my Atlanta Falcons, I am continuing in my New Years 2017 Tournament of Roses.  This started, appropriately, during the Rose Bowl ceremonies and football game on January 2nd.  The premise of the tournament is to explore some of the uniqueness that Four Roses brings about with their 10 recipes under one label. 

**Recap** 

* [Round 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/5locda/reviews_3234_tournament_of_roses_round_1/) - pitted 3 Small Batch Limited Editions against each other.  I reviewed them blind to see which one is the best (to me, of course).  
* [Round 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/5mmv7l/reviews_3639_tournament_of_roses_round_2_wheres/) explored the question of just how good the Single Barrel LE’s really are.  I Reviewed 4 different pours blind.  Three were Private Barrels and one was 2016 Single Barrel Limited Edition (Elliott’s Select).   
* Round 3 will explore barrel variance between a single 4R recipe.  I will try 3 different OBSF’s.  One 12 year that I have enjoyed a lot.  An OBSF picked by a 4R brand ambassador for Tippins and a Binny’s select.

What I've got in front of me is 3 samples of Hirsch Selection Rye, aged 21, 22, and 25 years respectively.  The first and the last are of unknown provenience (that is to say, I've quite forgotten) while my notes indicate the 22 year came to me courtesy of /u/HD335.  Much like my samples, the provenience of the whisky itself is shrouded in mystery.  /u/signde talked about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1usrd2/anyone_know_anything_about_hirsch_25_year_old_rye/), and that seems to be the best information available.  It seems like these were the barrels that were not good enough for Rathskeller, 24/94, 24/110, Red Hook, Velvet Glove, Iron Fist, etc, etc, so KBD decided to bottle it up and label it with a name (Hirsch) that had some momentum at the time and hope for the best.  Seems like they did it at the same time as Willett was selling similar barrels at the gift shop.

I bet they wish they had tanked it and waited for 2017 to release it.

Name is Knob Creek 9 Small Batch
Review is **Whisky Network Reviews #70-71**


Canada is not an ideal place to go bourbon hunting, but we do get a lot of the major brands – and often at very reasonable prices (at least here in Ontario).  I thought I would add my views on two common low-rye mashbill bourbons, Elijah Craig 12 Year Old and Knob Creek 9 Year Old.


Fun fact: although EC 12 has virtually disappeared in most jurisdictions, replaced by the NAS "Small Batch" version, you can routinely still find EC 12 age-stated bottles here in Ontario.  Indeed, up until a few weeks ago, it was common to find the *older* bottles with the "12" prominently displayed on the front. The latest batch received by the LCBO is the intermediate style, with the "12" move to small type on the back.  Once these are all gone, I imagine we will be receiving the regular NAS small batch.  Don't ask me why we are so far behind the curve, but no one is likely to complain.  ;) My bottle is actually one of the older EC 12s with the age on the front. Produced by Heaven Hill, and bottled at 47% ABV. Currently $48 CAD at the LCBO.


Knob Creek is one of the premium bourbon brands put out by Beam.  It still has its 9 year old age statement (for now), and is bottled at a higher proof (50% ABV). I understand from the guide here that 
Knob Creek comes off the stills at a lower proof than standard Jim Beam, thus retaining a little bit more spirit character than the main line. Similarly available for $48 CAD at the LCBO, but I recently sampled this from a 50mL miniature bottle while in the US (glass bottle, shown as the accompanying image above). As an aside, a nice miniature scale reproduction of the larger bottle, right down to the engraved lot code on the back.

Round 1 pits two classic, and perennially sub-recommended bourbons against each other.   Eagle Rare and a bourbon that some people are trying to keep a secret.

Do you have hardwood floors?  Did you chew on your pencils as a kid?  Do you sprinkle sawdust in your morning coffee grounds prior to brewing as you eat your cereal from a quarter cask?  Then prepare yourself for OAKSTRAVAGANZA 2017!!!  

Born and raised in Savannah, GA, I have always had a love for the oak.  Especially the [Live Oak trees](http://imgur.com/gr9jEKH) that dotted the landscape of my hometown.  More relevantly, I have really been enjoying oak forward bourbons this fall & (so called) winter.  So I have decided to do a somewhat unique mega review/ competition of sorts between some  decently available bottles I have been recently enjoying.  I will review each bourbon overall and for excellence in oak execution or “oaksecution” (I really can’t help myself)  I will gather all the bourbons where I enjoy the oak profile and and group them.  Group winners will be declared and finally a champion will be crowned.  These are just the various bourbon brands that I have tried and enjoyed for their oak presence.  Please let me know if I am missing your favorite oak bomb!

EC12 has been a staple of mine since I have been enjoying bourbon.  It is the reason I knew I love oak forward bourbon in the first place.  The quasi mythical figure behind the brand is the namesake of my reddit handle (History, Schmistory, the guy came up with charring oak barrels all by himself… just deal with it… but I digress).  Can any bourbon compete???  Enter the man the myth, the way overhyped,  W.L. Weller 12, who, based on secondary prices alone, should rout EC12.  

In a way this round represents two casualties of the bourbon bubble, ghosts as it were, duking it out.  One largely unavailable and the other now defunct. It’s kind of like when someone poses a hypothetical football game (e.g., could the 80’s Raiders have beaten the 70’s Steelers?), except this is real life my friends.

So my team just got bounced out of the NCAA Tourney but this is a great consolation prize, drinking great Rye and sharing my thoughts with r/bourbon. That standard Rye flavor was starting to bleed together a bit after last night's matches but today was fairly varied to much my surprise! On with the final matches of the first round! Here's the current [bracket](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1psEE9GlD3kd9C3dIjhssH4fJNe-EWhSsbId4-VxISMw/edit#gid=0) as it stands today and will be updated with the Elite 8 tomorrow evening.

Name is Belle Meade 9 Single Barrel Liquor Barn
Review is 

a nice average bourbon that doesn’t wow, but doesn’t disappoint either. Probably a lot of variation given these are single barrel releases, but I’d be tempted to pick this up as a nice cocktail bourbon or simple sipper.

Name is Flatboat Straight Bourbon
Review is I was at a friend's place in Windsor this weekend and he has a fantastic, growing collection of whiskies that he picks up in his business travels.  [Here's a post on the TWS website with a bit more detail about the weekend including why there is a picture of fire and a scared waitress!](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/2017/04/06/some-ndp-bourbon-reviews/?preview_id=2797&preview_nonce=b4905b2511) I decided to try a bunch of sourced bourbon rather than the distillery releases, as they're the ones I'm less likely to get a chance to try in the future. Notes will be pretty short, as I was more focused on socializing than taking detailed notes.

Name is Jack Daniel's Old No. 7
Review is Info: I haven't had Jack Daniels in a long time, recently one of the local bottle shops got a bunch of store picked single barrel and put it on sale for a decent price. It's so rare to see any kind of barrel selected store picks around me that I picked up a bottle otherwise I probably wouldn’t have given it much thought. I figured I might as well grab a mini of the No 7  and Gentleman Jack to try as well to get my baring's around the brand.

Review is A little while back I found a shop with some EWSB bottled in '06, and since this has always been one of my go-to Bourbons, grabbing a couple was a no brainer, even if it's not quite "dusty" status. I thought it would make for an interesting sbs with the current version too. I did this as a blind tasting to remove bias, but here's the specs on the two bottles, then on to the reviews:

**Evan Williams Single Barrel**, barrel 450, 43.3%

Review is Full disclosure up front: The [Toronto Whisky Society](https://torontowhiskysociety.ca/) (of which I am a founding member) was given these samples for review by the distillery. We have four [whiskies](http://www.dogooddistillery.com/spirits.html) here from [Do Good Distillery](http://www.dogooddistillery.com) out of Modesto, CA: Cherry Wood Smoked, Beechwood Smoked, Peat Smoked, and Benevolent Czar. The first three are, as you would imagine, malted barley smoked with different agents. The last whisky is supposed to be inspired by dark and sweet beers, so I'm guessing they may have used more heavily roasted barley (sometimes called chocolate malt) instead of the typical unroasted barley. Well, enough preamble, let's get to the whiskies.

Maker's Mark standard recipe is a wheated bourbon and they choose to use the "Whisky" spelling versus the more common "Whiskey" spelling for bourbons for some reason.

Review is The whiskey scene was a lot different just a few years ago. Great bargains like Smooth Ambler Old Scout single barrels sat on the shelves all day long for $40-$45. I wasn't oblivious to how good we had it and I went through more than my fair share of them, particularly the cask strength ryes. It seems like everyone was in on it too though because by early 2015 Smooth Ambler had run out of almost all their MGP rye stock and pulled  back to gift shop only releases for the few barrels they had remaining. With the help of a really nice internet friend I was lucky enough to get a bottle of the first limited release rye before it sold out in about an hour. I've been nursing it for almost 2 years now and after acquiring a sample of another limited release rye, I decided it was finally time to put it to rest.

Name is Peg Leg Porker Tennessee Straight Bourbon 12 Year
Review is Peg Leg Porker is a local Nashville BBQ restaurant run by Carey Bringle who lost a leg to bone cancer hence the name. Before I get into the whiskey let me say that Peg Leg is one of my favorite BBQ places in Nashville and if you are ever in town, you should go there. They specialize in pork and will be the first to tell you if you want brisket, go to Texas. Carey is a bit of a character and in my discussions with him seems like a really fun/nice guy.

From what I recall, the Peg Leg whiskey brand started about 3-4 years ago as a no age statement product but since then has launched an 8 year and just recently a limited edition 12 year. The process for all those products has been the same - it's a sourced Tennessee straight bourbon whiskey that is filtered through hickory charcoal before bottling. Most whiskey nerds know there is pretty much one major Tennessee distillery selling bulk whiskey and that's George Dickel. Dickel whiskey has an odd profile that wears on some due to a weird multivitamin mineral note that is very present in their products but personally I've come to terms with it. For the record, I have no factual evidence that the source here is Dickel other than my own experience tasting their products. When Peg Leg whiskey was first launched I asked Carey where it was sourced and he told me he signed an NDA that prevented him from revealing the details.

Anyway, there’s plenty of info on the web about these two, but I recall being rather disappointed with the 17yr. It was perfectly fine, but not worth 2+ good Russell’s picks. I tried the Decades when I first got it and thought it was better, but still underwhelming. Let’s see how the two compare side by side!

So I decided to go for some Bourbon’s. First up was Rittenhouse BiB, a rye from Heaven Hill.

Review is Long story short, I recently found out that in addition to being 10 years old Eagle rare is also a Single Barrel Bourbon. But they don't put it on the label for reasons that have to do with the bottling line process. You can find out more information in a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/7u5npk/some_info_on_the_eagle_rare_bottling_process/). So I thought it would be fun to do a blind side-by-side of two different bottles, one being a standard bottle and one being a K&L pick that is 11yr 6mo old.

So for my last reviews coming from a recent Toronto Whisky Society tasting a couple of great guys brought out some lesser found Sazerac produced bourbons so a big thanks to /u/Devoz and Mark Bylok for letting us try these interesting whiskies!

Elmer T. Lee is a bourbon produced at Buffalo Trace Distillery and is named for the distillery's first ever master distiller. He rose all the way into the position after getting employed at the distillery as a maintenance engineer and ended up working for the distillery for 36 years and continued afterwards to act as an ambassador for the distillery until his passing in 2013. Given that Mr. Lee dedicated one of his final bourbons, Blanton's Single Barrel, to his old boss at the distillery it was fitting that Buffalo Trace ended up naming a bourbon for him as well. Elmer T. Lee is a sour mash single barrel straight bourbon whisky that is bottled at 90 proof and since the bourbon boom it became nearly impossible to find a bottle of this whisky on the shelves anymore. This bourbon uses Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 making it a high rye bourbon and allegedly these whiskies are aged up to 12 years but for now I'll say they're NAS as I'm not entirely sure on that.

So luckily I did a side by side with 2 years of Elmer T. Lee so let's see how they do separate and together!

Review is Don't know much about "Backbone Bourbon Company" other than the fact they bottle some Barrel proof MGP Rye in the form of Bone Snapper. And being a huge fan of MGP Rye, that's enough to get my attention. ~~I don't think there's anything older than 4 years~~, and my Bevmo bottle is actually only about 3.5 years, which might be indicative of the current high demand for this juice. Nice of them to give us an age statement though on something so young, and the stuff only goes for about $60 which is a pretty good price imo.

Blind Sample 1: >!Batch 12, 132.3/66.15%!<

Blind Sample 2: >!Batch 8, 129.5/64.75%!<

**Post Reveal Thoughts:** This makes me happy, because the winner is the bottle I currently have open! It seems like there's more buzz around later batches so I'm honestly surprised by the results, but it totally works for me. 

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out.

2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice.

3 | Bad | Multiple flaws.

4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but many things I'd rather have.

5 | Good | Good, just fine.

6 | Very Good | A cut above.

7 | Great | Well above average

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional.

9 | Incredible | An all time favorite

10 | Perfect | Perfect

Name is Stagg Jr. Batch #8
Review is **

Both of these are delicious, and I never noticed before but they aren't as heavily oaky as other bruisers like ECBP and KCSB. Still epicly huge and hot in the same vein with lots of corn and hot cherry sweetness, and tons of hot spice. 1 is hot and punchy, much more spice heat and brash flavor. 2 is a little richer and more well rounded, thicker mouthfeel, richer oak, more syrupy-sweet cherry, but without losing any of it's huge brash character. Both are good but 2 is the clear winner for me.

**Score:**

Blind Sample 1: **8**

Blind Sample 2: **9**

Name is Sagamore Spirit Rye Signature Straight
Review is 

It's an "ok" rye but lacking in complexity and too herbal for what I prefer in rye whiskey. The honey notes are nice but there's definitely too much herbality, which is a gripe I have with craft whiskey, so this one isn't something I'd consider buying.

To begin, *I was certain I preferred the '20* \- sweet, buttery, "butterscotch bomb" (as Minnick put it) *to the more "wintery, spicy 2018."*  Good thing I ran it blind!  I lost all track of my open 2020 as I numbered the glasses and then played a shell game for a couple mins with the three Glencairns, all the while, Sunday night football on the background.  I am a horrible multi-tasker/ thinker, so this tactic works every time!  Here's what I found:

Review is **Opening Statement:** I've known for a long time that I wanted to do a blind side by side review of the Old Forester 150th Anniversary release ever since I was able to get my hands on one of the batches. Luckily enough I had a local friend (u/Chardogg) get a bottle of another batch and  was able to get a sample of the final missing batch from an excellent member of the bourbon community u/Prepreludesh, who runs [The Bourbon Culture](http://www.thebourbonculture.com/) and is on Instagram [@bourbonculture](https://www.instagram.com/bourbonculture/). It took me some time to actually line this up and what better way to celebrate 200 reviews than with a big blind side by side of this venerable release from 2020. So as not to totally skew myself on this review I also added in a store pick of Old Forester Single Barrel Cask Strength that I had recently gotten to see how it can stack up to the rest of the field. And finally, I also wanted to pair this review with my album of the year Gami Gang by Origami Angel (more on that below).

I wanted to post this because over the past year I've really enjoyed what Lucky Seven has put out so far, and yet they seem to be the red-headed step-child of sourced releases. For example, the 14 Year "The Proprietor" release reviewed below has been lingering on their website, available to ship, for a few months now. Contrast this with recent NAS Blue Run releases which are roughly as expensive as The Proprietor, yet sell out instantaneously.

Review is Spoiling my review a bit here, but like many others Russell’s Reserve 13 was one of my favorite whiskeys of 2021. If it was not hard to find on release and in the subsequent months, its #1 spot on Fred Minnick’s 2021 Best Of list has pushed the secondary market for this bottle even higher.

And then we have the regularly available, off the shelf, Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel. I need to first come clean about a particular kind of stupidity: the availability of this bottle led to a snobbish avoidance. The thinking went something like “It’s around. I’ll try it eventually, right?” Now, Russell’s Reserve 13 is going to be an annual release from Wild Turkey, but I like to assume the worst and figure it may be a while before I get my hands on another bottle. As such, how does the off the shelf Single Barrel offering hold up side by side as a (significantly more available) substitute?

Now, given all that I am smidge dubious that there will be a HUGE variance in the off-the-shelf OWA as compared to a pick.

This is my first time trying an OWA pick so let’s see how they compare!

Review is Quick shameless local plug: if you are ever in DC, the folks at Cinder BBQ are awesome. In addition to being the opposite of snobbish about whiskey, they have a wide ranging, well priced selection and their picks tend to be top notch. Last year they had an accidentally double-oaked (leaky barrel issue required a second barrel to be used one year into aging) Peerless pick that was exceptional. Also, I am not boujee enough to go to Charlie Palmer, but they were involved in this pick too.

Charles and J.R. have been very friendly and engaging with the community on here, and were happy to stay after hours yesterday to give us a private tour and a tasting of some of their wares. J.R. went into a ton of detail regarding how they got started, the challenges facing small distilleries in Canada/Ontario, their process and their future plans. I noted down a few interesting facts that he shared that you guys might find interesting: 

* officially the government body that permits distillers to produce spirits in Canada is the Canada Revenue Agency... yup, the taxman strikes again

* before 2001, you couldn't get a license to distill without owning a still, and you couldn't buy a still without a license to distill. This caused Charles to almost get arrested at the border when he bought their first still and tried to bring it back to Canada, as the border guard didn't know about the 2001 Excise Act which enabled you to buy a still so long as you had applied for a license. 

* an excise warehouse at the distillery can be any specific place within the distillery. for TDC, it's a red shelf at the back of the room. At that point, the product is still owned by TDC and the excise tax owed on it is deferred until it leaves the warehouse. as soon as it moves from that shelf to the front of the room for sale or shipping, tax is owed to the government (enforced by monthly tax returns). 

* the LCBO owns that liquor as soon as it leaves the excise warehouse. From that point, TDC can sell to the public, but they're officially selling on behalf of the LCBO, who pays them a very generous $1.30 commision for performing that service. what a deal!

* TDC sources their grain from K2 milling and it all comes from local farms in the Schomburg area north of Toronto. their batches don't get blended, so terroir/climate patterns will affect the flavour. They also use organic yeast and enzymes, also locally sourced.

We stopped by on Jan 21, 10 days before they are planning to shutter their doors, because the taxation system on liquor in Ontario has made it difficult for them to make any money operating in Toronto. This is a real disappointment for those of us who enjoy innovative unique offerings from a local operation, and while we're grateful for the time we had to enjoy their stuff, [sadly it's coming to an end... sort of](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadawhisky/comments/5ok2km/toronto_distillery_co_is_closing_down/).

Most of what they make will be gin and unaged stuff, but they will have barrels stored, so hopefully we'll see a few more small batch releases in the future.

All beverage alcohol should be taxed equally, and ideally, there'd be an incubator system where small start-up distilleries aren't taxed on the first 'X' litres of alcohol sold, as has been done in numerous jurisdictions in Canada and elsewhere.

Got two Japanese single malts from Nikka today, both 10 year olds, both discontinued (at least over here). They are Yoichi and Miyagikyo.

Because of the huge popularity of Japanese whisky at the moment, they seem to have quickly run out of aged stocks and switched to NAS with spiralling prices going crazy the anything with an age statement. So I was lucky to find these in two bars.

Name is Bushmills Original
Review is **Whisky Network Reviews #74-76**


In my all-out pursuit for my next piece of flag flair, I thought I would cover a range of Bushmills - one of the oldest distilleries in Ireland.


Bushmills Original blended whisky (aka white label) is the flagship for the distillery. Unusually, this is a blend of column-distilled grain whisky and single malt (as opposed to single pot still, used to flavour most Irish whiskies). Bushmills may be thought of as more scotch-like in that sense, but it is still triple-distilled like other Irish whiskies (producing a lighter spirit). Bottled at 40% ABV, and currently $32 CAD at the LCBO.


Black Bush is a blended whisky, but it is a step-up from the standard Original. The malt comes from a mix of Oloroso sherry casks and ex-bourbon casks. This malt component makes up a significantly higher relative proportion of the blend than typical (i.e., I've seen 80% reported online). It is NAS, but I've seen various statements online that the malt component has been aged for "up to 7 years" or even for "8-10 years" before blending with the grain.  Bottled at the standard 40% ABV, and currently $37 CAD at the LCBO. 


Sherry Cask Reserve is a travel retail exclusive bottling, the first of a new "Steamship" collection from Bushmills. Sherry Cask Reserve is pure single malt whisky, matured exclusively in Oloroso sherry butts.  It is a NAS whisky, however, and is still oddly bottled at the minimum strength of 40% ABV. It also isn't cheap, working out to about $140 CAD for a bottle the last time I saw it in a duty free.


For these tasting notes, I sampled Bushmills Original in bar, and compared Black Bush and Sherry Cask Reserve head-to-head through free samples in the duty free (they were both on promotion).

Review is Hi everyone,

Because I’m awesome and have the most epic job in the world I get to work at whisky festivals. It’s a relatively new thing, but I’m loving it because it doesn’t feel like work.

So this Saturday I was in the Netherlands for ‘Whisky in Leiden.’ A great event on all fronts, hosted in a huge church with a bunch of amazing whiskies. I was with Bresser & Timmer on their stand and on the stand with me was Speciality Drinks and Teeling as well as a few other whiskies.

Knowing that I’ve only tried 8 Irish whiskies and 400 or so Scottish, I felt like I should make an effort with Teeling. Many thanks go to Shane, the awesome guy presenting the whiskies for Teeling.

Review is **Whisky Network Reviews #85-86**

Among some Irish whisky drinkers that I know, the entry-level Powers Gold is generally considered to be of higher quality than most other common blends (i.e., Bushmills, Tullamore Dew, etc.). I haven't had it yet, but I thought I would try the next bottles up in their series - the single pot still Powers Signature Release and Powers 12 Year Old John's Lane.

Powers is currently produced by Midleton, which also makes all the other well-known single pot still Irish whiskies (i.e., Redbreast, Green Spot, etc.). The Powers label was originally owned by John's Lane Distillery, which was shuttered during the massive distillery consolidation in Ireland in the 1970s.

To celebrate my 100th whisky network review here, I thought I would report on the vilest whisky that I have ever tried. :)

But first a little background – on a recent trip to Zurich, I managed to try a number of Swiss single malts. Appenzeller Säntis Malt ("Swiss Alpine Whisky") is an offshoot of a brewery (Brauerei Locher).  A signature feature is their use of old beer barrels for aging. Santis has been distilling since 1999 (when production first became legal in Switzerland), and they are currently one of the largest malt whisky producers there. 

Three of their current bottlings were available there as 50 mL sample bottles (ranging from ~$8-11 CAD each).  Let's see what they are like.

Smögen is an example of the new breed of "craft" whisky distillers setting up operations in Sweden. Established in 2009 by a young couple in the coastal region of Bohuslän, it is of course only recently that their whiskies have become available for sale (well, “available” for those in-the-know in that part of the world). Smögen currently only has capacity for about 35,000 litres per year. So it will be some time before these show up more widely, I expect.

I received these two samples of Smögen whisky from a swap with Whisky Saga’s Thomas Øhrbom earlier this year.

Review is First off, let me say thank you to /u/cpfselfbuilt for the sample of Amrut Spectrum.  And thank you to myself for buying the bottle of Spectrum 004.  Now, for some background.  Spectrum was released last year, 1000 bottles total.  It was aged in hybrid casks that were made of 5 types of wood: virgin American oak, virgin French oak, virgin Spanish oak, ex oloroso sherry, and ex px sherry.  Amrut Spectrum 004 is actually the second batch of Spectrum, and is named 004 because it was aged in hybrid casks that only contained 4 types of wood, with the virgin Spanish oak being axed from the previous release.  This was released earlier this year in a quantity of 1800 bottles world wide, with 600 going to the U.S.  So, with all that out of the way, let's get tasting!

Jameson Irish Whiskey is a staple in my whisky cave. It's nothing special, but it's a solid pour that even non-whisk(e)y drinkers are familiar with and seem to appreciate. And when you have company over on St. Patrick's Day, as I often do, it is just expected that you'll have Jameson. Never mind the fact that I have a lot of other Irish whiskies that are much more highly regarded; I give the people what they want. They are Irish that day, after all, so they should know.

Haven’t actually put a lot of my Kavalan reviews up yet, although I do have a few that I’m sure I’ll get round to at some point. Probably. 

I’ve never been *(sorry)* super impressed, as other seem to be, with Kavalan. I always found it was a little out of kilter despite having a lot of intensity and sweetness, it needs to be balanced. Then trying the very expensive Fino I was put off, as I found it super weird. Kavalan just wasn’t for me I thought. 

This was confirmed recently when I very briefly (although didn’t review) the very expensive Amontillado Solist and again, wasn’t impressed.

This all changed in Frankfurt. When I had a chance to try the very expensive PX Solist.

Name is La Alazana 46
Review is Thanks to /u/theslicknick6 for these samples.  La Alazana is a distillery in Patagonia, which is a region that includes part of Argentina and Chile.  The distillery is on the Argentinian side, which is the much bigger side.  They focus on making single malt.  From what Nick has said, it seems like they used to distribute, but now only sell at the distillery as demand has risen.  He was nice enough to send me a sample of both the regular single malt as well as the sherry cask.  Not sure how old these are, but by now, we should know that age isn't everything.

Name is Yoichi 1991 Single Cask
Review is Hi everyone,

Some rare Japanese whisky today from Mars and Yoichi.

Mars in particular I was keen to try, as the distillery closed for a long time and has only been producing again for the last few years. I had heard legendary things about the old stuff.

In the end, it turned out the other way round. The 3yo single cask I tried a while ago was way better than this one.

Index is 31666
Name is Nikka Coffey Grain
Review is  - solid single malt Scotch style Japanese whisky with tell-tale Nikka banana flavors held back by a lack of depth to the flavors, a lack of oak and a thin mouthfeel.

————

There you have it! Final order:

Nikka Whisky from the Barrel - 92
Yamazaki 12 Yr -88
Nikka Yoichi - 85
Nikka Coffey Grain - 78
Nikka Coffey Malt - 75

That banana note in the Nikkas, once it’s in your head it really gets lodged in there and shows up on every sniff and sip. Im surprised at how much more I enjoyed the Yoichi and Coffey Malt since the last time I tried them. I’m not surprised by the NWftB scoring so high as Barrel Proof and Sweet, punchy whiskies are definitely my jam. Hope you all enjoyed this insanely long review!

Review is This is the sixth in a series that I'm now calling MoM's gone wild, in which I review lots of samples I recently purchased off Master of Malt when I splurged perhaps a bit too much and bought pretty much anything that was being produced in a country that is not necessarily known for whisky production.  These are samples of Omar Single Malt from Nantou Distillery in Taiwan.  Most people have probably heard of Kavalan, who is putting out some great stuff in Taiwan.  I haven't heard much about Omar, but lets see if they can live up to their big brothers.

Review is Hi everyone,

Two from Paul John today, the first, very average and the second, very special. 

I have to admit, I don’t know too much about the distillery itself and I haven’t tried enough from these guys and Amrut so I’ll try and make an effort to try more.

Name is Lot No. 40 11 Cask Strength
Review is Reviews 99-100: Lot 40 Cask Strength 11yr (2018) vs Lot 40 Cask Strength 12yr (2017)


If you have been paying any attention, the original Lot 40 Cask Strength 12yr was the darling of Canadian whisky releases last year. A well priced, cask strength 100% rye that was widely available. Also helps it was bloody delicious. 

I would like to thank Corby/Wiser's who provided the sample of Lot 40 cask strength 11 year, the bottle of the 12 year I purchased last year. I try my best to not allow the nature or source of the pour influence my review.

This year it is followed up by a slightly younger version with a slightly higher ABV.  Let us see how they compare.

Name is Redbreast 12
Review is **Reviews #12-14: Round of Redbreast Robins (Redbreast 12 Year, 15 Year, & Lustau Edition)**

**Distillery:** Midleton Distillery

**Region:** Cork, Ireland

**Price:** $20 for 3 50 mL samples

My only prior exposure to Irish whiskey is in the form of Jameson. I figure that it isn’t the greatest representation of what Ireland can produce (or at least I hope not!) much like how Johnnie Walker or Jack Daniels isn’t the best representation of scotch or bourbon, respectively. Irish whiskey isn’t particularly hard to find in the market I live in, I can always find a bottle of Green Spot or Redbreast, but I’ve always been a bit apprehensive about buying a bottle. I was pleased to find this little sample set so I could try them out.

Name is Cooley 26 1992 Cadenhead's
Review is Hi everyone,

I don’t try a huge number of Irish whiskies. I just don’t tend to seek them out and there’s not a huge number available in UK and the festivals I attend in Europe. 

Or perhaps, there aren’t a huge number of the independent, older, cask strength, single cask releases I tend to be looking out for…

Anyway, I was doing a tasting at the Whisky Museum in Salzburg recently (great place), which also happens to be an Irish pub. 

The Jameson had been on my list for a while, because its part of the 101 whiskies to try before you die, but I’d never actually seen it in person. The Cadenhead’s speaks for itself (Many thanks to Chris for pouring me that one).

Name is Amrut Madeira Cask
Review is Hi everyone,

Amrut Indian single malt whisky is one that people do hype a little more than say Paul John. The Spectrum and Greedy Angels releases have gotten some big attention from people in the know, while certain single casks go for crazy money at auction. All good signs that the whisky is good stuff.

Trying the [Fusion] (http://www.daveswhiskyreviews.com/2016/11/amrut-fusion-review.html), I learnt that that was for good reason. Its good whisky. And I had the chance to try two others; one new, one not so new but both good.

Name is Eddu Gold
Review is Hi everyone,

Two more quick reviews today, this time for some random French whisky I tried a couple of years ago now.

Eddu is a whisky made at Distillerie des Menhirs in Brittany and started making whisky in 1998. But not from barley, from Buckwheat.

Weirdly, Buckwheat isn’t anything like Wheat because it isn’t a grass and, if anything, looks more like a flower. Anyway, the stuff has seeds (which are classed as ‘pseudocereals’) which can be malted, mashed and distilled. It is then distilled in a double distillation on a direct-fired Alembic-style still.

Name is Last Straw Stout Spirit
Review is **Reviews #76-78: Last Straw Distillery 3-Way Review (Darker Side of the Moonshine, Stout Spirit, 100% Ontario Sprouted Corn Whisky)**

The drams for this review were provided by Last Straw Distillery in Concord, Ontario, Canada, so a big thanks to /u/LastStrawDistillery and Mike Hook for letting me try some of their wares!

Given that I've been a member of Toronto Whisky Society for coming onto 3 years, I've had quite a number of experiences with Canadian distilleries. One of those distilleries lies a bit closer then most which is the Last Straw Distillery, who have been distilling a variety of spirits since they opened in ~~2016~~ (Edit: They originally opened in 2013 in Hillsburgh, Ontario before moving to the current distillery site in Concord back in 2015 according to their master distiller Don) and now have their first 3 year old whiskies in a 100% Ontario Rye and a 100% Ontario Sprouted Corn whisky. So today I'm going to be re-reviewing two of their underage brown spirits and their newest 3 year old whisky made from corn. So let's see how they do!

**Last Straw Distillery Darker Side of the Moonshine**

This originally launched back in early 2017 and was a double distilled version of their Dark Side of the Moonshine, a corn and sugar distillate aged for 4 months in heavily charred American oak casks. This sample was bottled at 45.5% ABV.

Name is Alberta Premium 20
Review is # Reviews #14 and 15 - Alberta Premium 20 YO and Cask Strength

Alberta Premium is a Canadian Distillery, founded in 1946, located in Calgary, Alberta, and now owned by the Suntory Beam conglomerate. It comes in a distinctive 70s-esque geometric decanter-style bottle, which [has actually been around since at least the 1970s](https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1975/6/1/it-doesnt-help-to-be-jewish-in-manitoba). Its claim to fame is being featured as the whisky of choice for the fine folks in Trailer Park Boys and also having controversially  snagged Jim Murray’s choice for top whisky of the year with its Cask Strength edition ([and then promptly distancing itself from that award](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/whisky-jim-murray-bible-sexist-calgary-distillery-1.5735292)).
 
Recently I was able to obtain bottles of both the Cask Strength and 20 YO editions, and I had previously reviewed the standard version of Alberta Premium as part of my [blind 12 rye roundup](https://reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/jgbld1/the_great_blind_ryeoff_reviews_213/) on /r/bourbon. I tried all three side-by-side (plus another tasting of just the 20 YO and CS), and include my mostly enjoyed on the standard edition below.
